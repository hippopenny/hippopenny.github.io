### Mission
**Hippo Penny** *creates personalized AI characters with distinct personalities and customizable, animated appearances that express emotions and engage users through gamified experiences.* 

### Proof of Concept
[Wacky Warper](/wackywarper) is our proof-of-concept game that showcases the power of Hippo Pennyâ€™s AI characters. In Wacky Warper, players can design and share characters that not only chat but also dress up, receive gifts, and express a range of emotions. These characters are dynamically animated, providing a visually engaging and interactive experience as they respond to player interactions. The game encourages players to share and interact with their creations, turning individual experiences into community-driven stories and networks. 

With millions of interactions in the first few weeks of soft launch, our game demonstrates the potential for significant user engagement even without marketing.
