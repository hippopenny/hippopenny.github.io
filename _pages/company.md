### Vision
We envision a world where humans and AI characters interact seamlessly, emotionally, and visually, blurring the lines between human and digital interaction.

### Mission
We enable everyone to create and share personalized, customizable, animated AI characters that evolve emotionally, transforming how people connect and play through gamified experiences.

### Proof of Concept
[Wacky Warper](/wackywarper) is our proof-of-concept game that showcases the power of Hippo Penny’s AI characters. Set in a playful, meme-inspired art style, Wacky Warper lets players create and share characters that not only chat but also dress up, receive gifts, and express a wide range of emotions. These characters are dynamically animated, providing an engaging, interactive experience that responds to player input in real-time.

Our platform elevates personalization by allowing players to tailor unique outfits using a cutting-edge tool that blends generative AI with artist-driven design. These outfits can be shared and monetized through our marketplace, unlocking new creative possibilities.

With millions of interactions in just the first few weeks of soft launch, Wacky Warper showcases the immense potential for user engagement.
