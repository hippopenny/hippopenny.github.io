## How It Works
We want more people to play and laugh with Wacky Warper. As a Hippo Penny creator partner, you will have a unique code to share with friends; and both of your friends and you will get a few cool in-game items to dress up characters. Furthermore, this is totally up to you if you desire, as a token of appreciation for you to spread the words, we are gladly to share a significant share of IAP revenues from your referrals. Our goal is to have more friends to join us in Wacky Warper, and have fun, not much of the IAP. For now, payments are available for the US and VN only if you decide to receive the appreciation token. Your contribution level is recorded in your (to-be) dashboard regardless. 

Here is how it works <sup style="font-size: small;">**</sup>
    
- Apply to become a creator partner by filling out the form below, or try to get a creator pack in-game.
- Receive your unique referral code. The code will show up in your user profile.
- Share your code with your network—TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, etc.
- Earn 15-35% commissions (if you want) whenever your code is used for in-app purchases, and your friends will receive free cool items.
- If your referrals become creators and recognize some commisions. We will double their amounts and share that bonus between both of you in their first 3 months.
