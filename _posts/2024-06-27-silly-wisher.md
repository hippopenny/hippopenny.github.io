**Gameplay and Mechanics**

Imagine pulling for your favorite Genshin characters, but instead of sleek, anime-style graphics, you get 2D caricatures that look like they’ve been drawn by a hyperactive 12-year-old. And honestly? It's glorious.

The game starts you off with enough resources to make 90 wishes, perfect for diving headfirst into the chaos. The pity system is here too, so you don’t have to manually count your failed attempts at getting Diluc or Mona. Out of resources? No problem! Just watch a few ads and you're back in business.

**Characters and Banners**

This game has all the characters, from obscure 4-star weapons to coveted 5-star characters, all in ridiculous forms. It updates frequently, so there’s always something new to pull. It’s like a never-ending parade of hilarity. And if pulling characters isn’t enough, you can mix them using the gene splicing feature. The results are often as horrifying as they are hilarious.

**Final Thoughts**

Silly Wisher for Genshin is a meme-filled, free-to-play parody of Genshin Impact’s wish system.
