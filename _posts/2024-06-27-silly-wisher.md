**Gameplay and Mechanics**

Imagine pulling for your favorite Genshin characters, but instead of sleek, anime-style graphics, you get 2D caricatures that look like they‚Äôve been drawn by a hyperactive 12-year-old. And honestly? It's glorious.

The game starts you off with enough resources to make 90 wishes, perfect for diving headfirst into the chaos. The pity system is here too, so you don‚Äôt have to manually count your failed attempts at getting Diluc or Mona. Out of resources? No problem! Just watch a few ads and you're back in business.
