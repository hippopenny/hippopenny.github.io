Super Mario is one of Nintendo's most popular and beloved franchises, and the release of each new Mario game is always highly anticipated by fans. One of the most interesting aspects of the Super Mario franchise is how it has evolved over the years, with each new game introducing new gameplay mechanics, power-ups, and worlds to explore.

One of the most controversial moments in the history of the Super Mario franchise was the release of "Super Mario Bros. 2" in 1988. The game was originally developed in Japan as a sequel to the original "Super Mario Bros.," but was deemed too difficult for Western audiences and was instead replaced with a version of the game called "Super Mario Bros. 2 USA."

The game was actually a re-skinned version of a Japanese game called "Doki Doki Panic," which was modified to feature Mario characters and elements.

One of the most noticeable differences between "Super Mario Bros. 2 USA" and the original "Super Mario Bros." is the gameplay. In the original game, players had to complete levels by reaching the end of the stage, while in "Super Mario Bros. 2 USA," players had to navigate through levels by using a combination of running, jumping, and lifting objects. The game also featured new power-ups, such as the ability to fly or turn enemies into coins.

Despite the initial disappointment from fans who were expecting a traditional Mario game, "Super Mario Bros. 2 USA" has since gained a reputation as a unique and enjoyable game in its own right. It has been praised for its creative level design, diverse cast of playable characters, and memorable enemies and boss battles.

The game's legacy has also been felt in other Mario games, with some of the power-ups and mechanics introduced in "Super Mario Bros. 2 USA" making appearances in later games in the series. Overall, "Super Mario Bros. 2 USA" remains an interesting and important entry in the Super Mario franchise, and is remembered fondly by many fans.
