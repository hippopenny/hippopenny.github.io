    "comment": "Tales of Arise is a delightful adventure that breathes new life into the long-standing Tales series. With its reinvigorated combat system, engaging story, and charming characters, this game is a must-play for JRPG fans. The fluid combat, intricate world-building, and campy themes make for an immersive and enjoyable experience, even if some stiff cutscene animations threaten to break the immersion. Whether you're a seasoned Tales veteran or a newcomer to the series, Tales of Arise delivers a fresh and captivating journey that will leave a lasting impression. Get ready to dive into a world filled with tragedies, achievements, and the power of friendship!",
