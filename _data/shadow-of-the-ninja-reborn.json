This remake has been making waves with its lovingly crafted gameplay and stunning visuals. The critics are eating it up, but I'll give you my two cents - and by \"two cents,\" I mean my sarcastic commentary.<br><br>According to Tengo Project, this game is more than just a simple update; it's an all-new experience that pays homage to the original. And honestly, who doesn't love a good nostalgia trip? It's like visiting your old gaming grandma and being greeted with a warm hug (just don't expect any free Doritos).<br><br>The Games Machine gave it a 93, saying it's a genuine rewrite of an eight-bit classic. That's nice, but did they mention the part where you'll be crying yourself to sleep because everything is just so... hard?<br><br>Forbes chimed in with their two cents (see what I did there?), pointing out how it's not just a remake, but a new and improved game that's refreshingly technical and gorgeous. Yeah, yeah, we get it - Tengo Project loves technical things like \"visuals\" and \"gameplay.\"<br><br>Coming in hot with an 86 are Impulsegamer, who seem to have enjoyed the experience despite some minor complaints about item changing (don't worry; I know what a cringeworthy gameplay mechanic is). Meanwhile, Pure Nintendo gave their thoughts on how this game might not be everyone's cup of tea - unless you're into retro-chaos and sharing it with friends. So, in short: bring your A-game (and don't leave your friend behind).<br><br>TouchArcade chimed in with a 70, pointing out that while this is a solid effort from Tengo Project, seasoned gamers might already have experience with this design sensibility - implying that others (read: my mom) will merely think, \"Oh, an old NES game?\" and promptly delete it.<br><br>Last but not least, NintendoWorldReport decided to join in the fun, praising its 70-scoring masterpiece by stating they wish there was a better save system in Arcade Mode. Too much? No too little! If you enjoy a challenge (or need more Doritos), get this!<br><br>There you have it, folks. From the experts' point of view and yours truly's sarcastic summary - Shadow of the Ninja: Reborn seems to be doing alright for itself, but won't make a lasting impression on our gaming grandmas... I mean, us.",
