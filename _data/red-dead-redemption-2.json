It's like everyone involved has suddenly become a connoisseur of video games, proclaiming it \"art\" and praising its every move. Now, don't get me wrong, RDR2 is an excellent game, but come on, people! Can we at least pretend to be slightly objective here?<br><br>IGN's review is typical of the bunch: \"a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era.\" Oh, wow, what a thrill-ride of adjectives! It's like they're trying to make me swoon. Game Informer's take is equally gushy, calling it \"the up-close portrayal of the outlaw Van der Linde gangâ€™s unraveling... depth and breadth of the open world is a technical triumph.\" Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it. You love it.<br><br>But what really gets my goat (or should I say, my horse's rear end?) are critics like Cheat Code Central who use words like \"power fantasy\" and \"examination of honor and morality.\" Um, isn't that just called a video game? Vandal's review is similarly over-the-top, calling it \"a masterpiece... everyone who even slightly enjoys video games should play.\" Gosh, I hope you're not planning on starting a petition to make Red Dead Redemption 2 the national treasure of America or something.<br><br>Game Revolution gets points for being somewhat restrained in their praise, but only because they're trying to sound cool by saying \"it's all high quality and doesn't feel tacked on.\" SpazioGames' review is similarly lukewarm, but let's be real, when you start using phrases like \"the new North Star for Open-world games,\" you might as well be waving a red flag and shouting, \"I'M A CRITIC AND I KNOW IT!\"<br><br>And then there's COGconnected. Oh boy, where do I even begin? They're so enthusiastic about the game that they start using words like \"phenomenal\" and \"groundbreaking.\" It's like they're trying to convince themselves (and everyone else) that Red Dead Redemption 2 is actually a sentient being with feelings and emotions. I mean, come on, guys, it's just a video game!<br><br>In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent game that has earned its critical acclaim. But let's not forget that we're still just reviewing a video game here, folks. No need to get too worked up about it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go play some Red Dead Redemption 2... or maybe just watch the sunset and contemplate the meaning of life.",
