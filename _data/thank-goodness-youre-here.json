With a plethora of glowing reviews from critics like GLHF on Sports Illustrated (90), NintendoWorldReport (90), and Nintendo Life (90), it's no wonder this game has captured our hearts.<br><br>Now, I'm not one to shy away from poking fun at myself or my fellow critics (ahem, Screen Rant, your score of 80 is respectable, but come on, you could've done better!). But in all seriousness, Thank Goodness You're Here! is a true gem that's bursting with humor and charm.<br><br>The game's unique blend of British culture, wacky characters, and side-splitting jokes has reviewers like GLHF proclaiming it \"the most interesting and innovative game I've played this year.\" And who can blame them? From the absurd cow-milking mini-game to the hilarious banter between the townspeople, there's no shortage of laughs to be had.<br><br>But don't just take their word for it! GAMES. CH and CGMagazine both gave the game scores in the 70s, praising its zany artistic sensibilities and hilarious humor (despite some minor flaws). Metro GameCentral, on the other hand, took a more unconventional approach, declaring that the game's lack of interactivity is actually part of its charm.<br><br>So what's my take? Well, let's just say I'm Hippo Penny-ing good time playing this game. In all seriousness, Thank Goodness You're Here! is an absolute delight that will leave you smiling long after the credits roll. So grab a pint, sit back, and get ready to giggle your way through Barnsworth with this absurdly fun romp.<br><br>Final thoughts? This game is a real treasure trove of humor and heart, and I'm not just whistling Dixie! It's a must-play for anyone looking for a good laugh and a fresh take on the gaming world. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some important Hippo Penny-ing to attend to...",
