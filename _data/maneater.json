    "comment": "Maneater is a hilariously absurd and entertaining game where you get to wreak havoc as a mutant shark, with a charmingly shallow combat system and a deliciously simplistic upgrade system. It's like being the star of your very own B-movie, complete with over-the-top action and underwater mayhem. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Dive in and embrace the absurdity of being a hulking megashark on a quest for revenge! Just be prepared for a bit of repetition along the way.",
