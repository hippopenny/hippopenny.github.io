From chomping unsuspecting beachgoers to engaging in epic battles with apex predators, Maneater provides a shark-sized serving of mindless fun. The shallow combat and simplistic upgrades may not sustain the excitement for the entire duration, but if you're looking for a short, sharp burst of bloody entertainment, Maneater takes the bait.",
