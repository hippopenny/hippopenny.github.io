As a seasoned critic, I've had my fair share of reviewing RPGs, but this one's got me feeling like a kid in a candy store (or in this case, a Moogle in a materia shop)!<br><br>So, let's get down to business. What do the other critics have to say about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? Well, GameMAG gave it a perfect score, calling it \"one of the finest games in Square Enix's entire history.\" Wow, that's some high praise! Screen Rant also raved about it, saying it challenges the idea that FF7 can't be topped within its own universe. Meanwhile, Vgames called it an \"amazing experience\" with a dense and fun open world.<br><br>GIGA gave it a 92, citing minor flaws but still calling it a must-play for fans of the series or those who want to know what all the fuss is about. GLHF on Sports Illustrated gave it a 90, praising its ability to recreate moments from the original game while also introducing new elements. Digitally Downloaded gave it a 90 as well, loving the expanded party and narrative.<br><br>The New York Times, however, was a bit more lukewarm, giving it a 78. They praised the game's world-building and diversions but noted that the contrast between gameplay and plot often ends up confusing.<br><br>Now, let's get to my own review!<br><br>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute blast! It's a love letter to fans of the original game, with its beautiful remade environments, memorable character moments, and epic battles. I mean, who doesn't want to explore the Gold Saucer or revisit Costa del Sol?<br><br>But what really sets Rebirth apart is its narrative. Kazushige Nojima has done an incredible job weaving together threads from the original game into a cohesive (and often mind-blowing) story. The ending, in particular, challenges everything we thought we knew about the FFVII plot!<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without some criticisms. I did find that the open-world sections can get a bit tedious toward the end – it's like trying to find your way out of the backrooms (or in this case, Midgar). But hey, most of that's optional, and I loved how the game rewarded me with special character moments.<br><br>In the end, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an unforgettable experience that will leave you breathless. It may not be perfect, but it's a testament to Square Enix's dedication to storytelling and world-building. So grab your materia, your Buster Sword, or whatever your go-to weapon is – and get ready for an adventure of a lifetime!",
