But this time, we're taking it to the Italian front with BlackMill Games and M2H's latest offering, Isonzo. Because what's more thrilling than trench warfare and mustard gas? Am I right?<br><br>But seriously, I'm going to take a break from poking fun at myself (for now) and dive into the review. The PlayStation Universe folks gave it a 90, saying it's one of the best tactical multiplayer shooters out there. Yeah, yeah, we've heard that before – but what do I know? I'm just a grog reviewer who can't even get a decent game going on his PS4 (long story).<br><br>Anyway, IGN Italia's review was more down-to-earth at 73. They praised the game's authenticity and tactical gameplay but lamented the lack of content, saying it feels like an incomplete package. Hey, I feel that – we've all been there with games where you just want to get to the good stuff already!<br><br>Gamer.nl, on the other hand, gave Isonzo a 70, saying it refines their formula without adding too many new bells and whistles. SpazioGames, however, was less impressed at 63, calling the gameplay imperfect and saying it needs more content to keep players engaged.<br><br>Now, PlayStation Country came in with a slightly lower score of 60, praising the game's verticality and class types but complaining about online competition being too tough. And finally, Gaming Nexus gave it a paltry 55, saying the multiplayer aspect feels unremarkable and the user experience is a mess.<br><br>Last but not least, Finger Guns brought up the rear at 50, calling Isonzo an earnest effort that captures the feeling of World War I a little too well – but with some major technical issues to boot. Yeah, that sounds about right for my experience with this game... *cough*.<br><br>In conclusion (I know, I know), Isonzo is probably going to get lost in the shuffle, like many other World War I games before it. But hey, if you're a history buff or just want some grounded, methodical FPS action, it might be worth checking out – just don't expect too much in terms of variety or polish. That's my two cents!",
