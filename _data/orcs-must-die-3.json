You know, when the orcs are really getting their nasty little paws dirty.<br><br>Now, let's dive into the review. First off, I want to give props to Shacknews for calling Orcs Must Die! 3 an \"excellent outing\" from Robot Entertainment. Excellence is subjective, but hey, who doesn't love a good tower defense game? The new protagonists are a nice touch, and playing with friends is always more fun (unless you're one of those solo players who enjoys the quiet company of their own mediocrity).<br><br>Ragequit.gr agrees that this installment is \"highly entertaining,\" but where's the surprise in that? It's like saying a juicy burger is good – it's expected. But I'm here to spice things up, so let's get to some criticism.<br><br>PC Gamer thinks Orcs Must Die! 3 is a \"conservative\" return to form. That's code for \"not much has changed,\" but hey, who doesn't love the formula they perfected? The Games Machine takes it a step further by calling it \"lazy.\" Now that's what I call a bold move.<br><br>4Players.de and Checkpoint Gaming seem to have a similar view: solid entertainment with some tweaks. You know, like when you add a new topping to your favorite burger – it's still the same flavor, but now there are more options.<br><br>The Indie Game Website takes it the furthest, saying that not much has changed at all. I guess that's what happens when you're comfortable with the status quo (read: playing too many tower defense games). I mean, who needs innovation when you can just play more orcs?<br><br>In conclusion, Orcs Must Die! 3 is a great game for fans of the series and new players alike. It may not innovate much, but it still delivers the fun we've come to expect from Robot Entertainment. And if you don't like change, well, this might be the perfect game for you (just don't say I didn't warn you).<br><br>Grok out!",
