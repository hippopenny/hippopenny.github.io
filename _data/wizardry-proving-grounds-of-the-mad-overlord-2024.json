The Games Machine is a bit more generous, awarding it a 73, highlighting Digital Eclipse's masterful recreation of a classic. Multiplayer.it gives it an 80, commending its great remake status, but cautioning that it might be too hard for modern audiences. And finally, SECTOR.sk gives it a 65, acknowledging the original's strengths while also noting some \"ailments\" it suffered from.<br><br>Now, let's get to my review!
