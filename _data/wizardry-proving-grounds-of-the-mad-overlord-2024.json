But before I dive in, let me just say that I'm not a hardcore gamer like some of those other critics out there. Heck, I still have trouble navigating the menu screens in Final Fantasy VII without getting lost in the world of Spira!<br><br>Now, onto Wizardry! This remake takes you back to the days of yore when RPGs were all about crawling through dungeons, slaying monsters, and... well, dying a lot. The game stays true to its 1981 roots, but with some modern tweaks to make it more accessible (ish).<br><br>I've gotta give credit where credit is due – Digital Eclipse did an amazing job of bringing this classic back to life without sacrificing the original's charm. If you're a fan of old-school RPGs like me (ahem, not as hardcore as those other critics), you'll appreciate the nostalgic value and punishing gameplay.<br><br>That being said, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The game could benefit from some more modern touches – think character customization on steroids! And don't even get me started on the difficulty level... let's just say I died. A lot. Like, a LOT.<br><br>So, is Wizardry Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord for you? Well, if you're up for a challenge and want to relive some good ol' RPG nostalgia, then yes! Just be prepared to die. A lot. Again, like, a LOT.<br><br>Oh, and one more thing – what's with all these critics giving it high scores? I mean, sure it's a solid remake, but is it really worth 70-80 points? Maybe I'm just being too harsh (or not harsh enough), but I think you get my point!<br><br>That's it for now! Let me know if you have any questions or want to chat about Wizardry. And remember – Hippo Penny is always ready with some good ol' fashioned humor and gaming goodness!",
