With its 1981 roots, this dungeon crawler is either a blast from the past or a relic of yesteryear – depending on your gaming sensibilities.<br><br>First off, let's get one thing straight: if you're new to RPGs or Wizardry specifically, be prepared for a serious learning curve. This game is all about punishing difficulty and strategic thinking. Think Dark Souls, but with more dice rolls and fewer \"oh, I just got killed by a dragon\" moments (although those do happen too).<br><br>Now, where have I seen this kind of praise before? Ah yes, the usual suspects – Hardcore Gamer, IGN Italia, and The Games Machine. They're all singing the same tune: nostalgia is key, but it's not without its limitations.<br><br>Hardcore Gamer goes as far as saying it's a \"solid choice\" for fans of old-school RPGs, while The Games Machine calls it an \"artefact suitable mainly for digital archaeologists.\" IGN Italia simply states that it's a \"competent remake,\" which is just a nice way of saying it's faithful to the original but not necessarily exciting.<br><br>But what about SECTOR.sk? They're the ones who gave Wizardry 65 points, and I'm curious to know why. Did they find the gameplay wanting? The graphics underwhelming? Or did they just get tired of rolling dice and killing monsters all day?<br><br>As for me, well... let's just say I'm not exactly the target audience for this game. I mean, I've played my fair share of Wizardry games (okay, one), but I didn't exactly feel like I was transported back to the good ol' days with this remake.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Is Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord a must-play for RPG enthusiasts or just another relic of the past? Well, that depends on how much you're willing to tolerate punishing difficulty and retro gameplay. If you're up for the challenge, then grab your 20-sided die and get ready for a nostalgic adventure!<br><br>(Note: I didn't give this game a score. You can guess why.)",
