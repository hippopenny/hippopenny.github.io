Well, let me start by saying that this remake is a nostalgic treat for old-school RPG enthusiasts. It's like revisiting an old friend who still has some great stories to tell (and maybe a few gray hairs). The game respects its roots, which is awesome, but also might make it a bit challenging for newer players. After all, who wants to relive the good ol' days of punishing difficulty and cryptic instructions?<br><br>I mean, I'm not saying it's bad that the game has kept its old-school charm. In fact, it's what makes Wizardry so endearing. It's like a time capsule filled with memories of pixelated adventures and tedious exploration (just kidding... or am I?). But seriously, if you're new to the series or RPGs in general, be prepared for a steep learning curve and some serious frustration.<br><br>Now, where do the other critics fit into this picture? Well, let's start with Hardcore Gamer, who gave Wizardry a solid 70. They praised its nostalgic value and punishing gameplay experience (because what's an RPG without a little challenge, right?). However, they also mentioned that the game could benefit from some character customization options and a more forgiving approach for new players.<br><br>IGN Italia seems to have had a similar experience, giving Wizardry a score of 70 as well. Their comment? \"A competent remake of a 1981 dungeon crawler which most probably remained way too much faithful to the original game.\" Ouch, that sounds like a not-so-subtle hint at the game's limitations.<br><br>The Games Machine, on the other hand, was a bit more enthusiastic, awarding Wizardry a score of 73. They praised Digital Eclipse's ability to breathe new life into classics and even called Wizardry a \"masterstroke.\" However, they also mentioned that the game's mechanics are a bit dated and might only appeal to digital archaeologists looking for a nostalgic fix.<br><br>Finally, we have Multiplayer.it, which gave Wizardry an 80. Their comment? \"Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is a great remake of a great classic, maybe too hard for the modern audience.\" Well, I guess that's one way to put it - too hard for some folks, but still a great game in its own right.<br><br>And then there's SECTOR.sk, which gave Wizardry a more lukewarm 65. Their comment? \"The modern incarnation of Wizardry shows the strengths of the forefather of dungeon crawler, but also the ailments it suffered from.\" Yeah, I think we can all agree on that one - the game is what it is, and that's okay.<br><br>In conclusion (or should I say, \"conclusion-ium\"?), Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is a great remake for fans of old-school RPGs. It's not perfect, but it's got heart, and sometimes that's all you need to make a game truly enjoyable. So, if you're up for a challenge (or just want to relive some good ol' gaming memories), then Wizardry is definitely worth checking out.<br><br>And that's Hippo Penny - Hippo Penny!",
