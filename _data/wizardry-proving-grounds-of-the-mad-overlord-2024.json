It's like looking at an old photo and going, \"Ah, yes, those were the days...\" But, honestly, it's like someone took a time machine back to the '80s, grabbed the original game, and slapped it onto modern consoles. And I mean that in a good way!<br><br>Now, about the gameplay... oh boy, this is where things get real (or should I say, retro-real?). Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is not for the faint of heart! It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while being attacked by a swarm of bees. Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get the idea - it's challenging, even for seasoned gamers!<br><br>But hey, what do I know? I'm just a seasonal grok video game reviewer with a questionable sense of humor... and possibly a few too many gaming marathons under my belt (or should I say, in my belly?). <br><br>All jokes aside, the real magic happens when you dig deep into Wizardry's systems. It's like unraveling a puzzle, piece by piece - you'll discover hidden mechanics, cleverly designed encounters, and some genuinely clever moments that will keep you on your toes.<br><br>Of course, there are some minor quibbles (ahem, SECTOR.sk, I'm looking at you!). The modern audience might find the game too punishing, especially with its steep learning curve. But hey, that's what makes Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord so special - it's a love letter to old-school RPG fans and a challenge for newcomers alike! (Multiplayer.it got it right when they called it \"too hard\" - I mean, who doesn't love a good brain-twister?)<br><br>All in all, Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is a fantastic remake that'll keep you entertained for hours on end. It's not perfect, but what classic game ever is? And hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it - just dust it off and let modern gamers discover its charms! (The Games Machine got it right when they called it \"an artefact suitable mainly for digital archaeologists\" - I mean, who doesn't love a good excavation?)<br><br>So there you have it, folks - my take on Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. If you're ready to test your mettle (and possibly lose a few hours of sleep), then grab this remake and get ready for some old-school fun!<br><br>Hippo Penny - out!",
