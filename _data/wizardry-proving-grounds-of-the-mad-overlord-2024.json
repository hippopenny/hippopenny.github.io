Now, I know what you're thinking - another old-school RPG remake? But trust me, folks, this one's got some serious mojo.<br><br>First off, let's talk about the good stuff. Digital Eclipse has done an amazing job of respecting the original game's roots while still making it feel fresh and exciting for new players. The combat system is deep and challenging, just like you'd want from a classic RPG. And the best part? It's not just a lazy port - these guys have put in the work to make sure this remake feels like a proper update.<br><br>Now, I know some of my fellow critics might be saying that Wizardry: Proving Grounds is too punishing or too old-school for new players. But honestly, folks, if you're looking for a game that'll challenge you and keep you coming back for more, then this is the one. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're up for it, then get ready to dive in.<br><br>And hey, who knows? Maybe Wizardry: Proving Grounds will even bring out the inner hardcore gamer in some of us. After all, as Hardcore Gamer said, \"it remains a solid choice for those who appreciate old-school RPGs and are looking for a game that challenges their strategic thinking and patience.\" I mean, if it's good enough for them, then it's definitely worth checking out.<br><br>Now, let's not forget about IGN Italia - they're saying this remake is \"competent,\" which, let's be real, is basically code for \"it gets the job done.\" And hey, when you've got a classic like Wizardry on your hands, sometimes that's all you need. A solid foundation to build upon.<br><br>The Games Machine took it a step further, praising Digital Eclipse for their work in breathing new life into this old-school gem. But even they acknowledged that Wizardry: Proving Grounds is starting to show its age, which is fair. I mean, let's be real - some classics are just meant to be left alone.<br><br>And then there's Multiplayer.it, who... well, never mind what they said. Quotation forthcoming? More like quotation lacking in my opinion! But hey, that's just me.<br><br>SECTOR.sk took a more critical approach, saying that while Wizardry: Proving Grounds is a nice nod to the original, it's not quite as convincing in terms of gameplay. And you know what? I think they might have a point. It's not perfect, but it's still a lot of fun.<br><br>So there you have it, folks - my take on Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. Is it perfect? No way. But is it worth checking out if you're a fan of old-school RPGs or just looking for a challenge? Absolutely. Just don't say I didn't warn you!",
