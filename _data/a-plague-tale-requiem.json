    "comment": "A Plague Tale: Requiem takes you on a thrilling, emotionally charged journey through the plague-ridden 14th-century France. With improved graphics, sound, and gameplay, it builds upon the success of its predecessor to deliver a compelling sequel. The story will uplift and decimate your emotions, while the characters feel real and relatable. The only downsides are some performance issues and predictable sneaking sections, but these are forgivable for the overall excellence of the game.",
