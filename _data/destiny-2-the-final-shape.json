Now, I know what you're thinking - another review of this game? But hear me out, folks! I've got some fun facts to share, and a whole lot of sass to throw around.<br><br>First off, let's talk about the critics. Oh boy, have they gone wild over The Final Shape! IGN Adria is giving it a 100% score, saying it's \"one of the best games Bungie has ever made.\" Dexerto is all about the sentimental value, praising it as a \"love letter to the social and community aspects of gaming.\" And COGconnected is just impressed - they're calling it \"Bungie's best work in the Destiny era.\"<br><br>But what about me? Well, I'm not here to give you a 100% score (although my cat might argue otherwise). No, I'm here to give you the real deal. The good, the bad, and the ugly.<br><br>So, let's get into it! The Final Shape is an expansion that wraps up the Light and Darkness saga in Destiny 2. And boy, does it deliver on its promise of emotional and exhilarating storytelling. The campaign is a wild ride, with twists and turns galore. And don't even get me started on the endgame activities - they're so much fun!<br><br>But what about the negatives? Well, there are some criticisms to be had. GamersRD is saying that the story is still lacking in some areas, and that the excessive recycling of old ideas gets a bit tiresome. Ouch.<br><br>So, who's the best critic out there? In my humble opinion (and I'm a seasonal grok video game reviewer, remember?), it's gotta be But Why Tho?. They're giving The Final Shape a 90% score and praising its emotional resonance. And I've got to agree - this expansion does bring some serious feels.<br><br>And then there's Slant Magazine, who are giving it an equally impressive 90%. Their review is all about the campaign, saying it's \"a surprisingly intimate reckoning\" for the major figures in the game. I mean, who doesn't love a good reckoning?<br><br>But what about The Games Machine? They're giving it an 85% score and praising its content - lots of new stuff to play with, including an outstanding campaign and exciting endgame activities. And that's something we can all get behind.<br><br>So, there you have it! That's my review of Destiny 2: The Final Shape. I hope you enjoyed the ride (and not just the cat puns). Stay groovy, everyone!",
