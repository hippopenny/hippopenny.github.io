Today we're diving into the wonderful world of Gundam Breaker 4, because why not?!<br><br>Let's start with the big boys (and girls) - Twinfinite gave this baby a whopping 90! That's like a unicorn in gaming terms. They loved it so much they said you \"don't need to be a fan of the larger Gundam franchise\" but honestly who wouldn't want to build their own custom robot and shred through enemies? Sounds like a dream come true!<br><br>Moving on we have Video Chums, who gave us an 84 - not bad, not bad at all! They're basically saying anyone can enjoy this game, \"any mech enthusiast can easily enjoy what's here\" which is awesome because that means your grandma (grandda?) can play it too!<br><br>Now let's talk about Noisy Pixel (score: 80), they were super impressed with the attention to detail in the customization options. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned Gunpla-building experience? They even liked the story (mostly) but honestly who reads stories when you can build robots?<br><br>We have two critics stuck at 75 - Digital Chumps and GamersRD (okay maybe that's too many Chumps). Both seem to agree that Gundam Breaker 4 is about customization, because let's be real if your Gunpla ain't fire it was all for nothing! <br><br>Last but certainly not least we have Push Square with their score of 70. All they can say is this game is \"a return to what the series does best\" which means more action, more grinding, and more... well you get it!<br><br>Lastly (okay not lastly we're rounding up) is GamingBolt saying this game is great for hardcore fans but meh for everyone else (score of 60). Yeah, that's like my gaming experience all in one sentence \"me!\"",
