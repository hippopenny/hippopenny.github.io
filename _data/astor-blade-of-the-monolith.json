Sounds like someone's trying to be too cool for school. But hey, I was pleasantly surprised! This old-school action RPG has some real charm.<br><br>First off, the combat is where it's at. You get to hack and slash your way through hordes of baddies with all sorts of sweet moves. It's like a big ol' party up in here! And the best part? You can customize your character with all sorts of nifty abilities. I mean, who doesn't love a good combo attack?<br><br>Now, some of my fellow critics (ahem, SpazioGames) said that Astor: Blade of the Monolith is just okay, that it's not particularly innovative or groundbreaking. But you know what? I think they're wrong! This game might not break new ground, but it knows exactly what it is and leans into those strengths. It's like a big ol' hug in game form.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the graphics. They're straight fire, baby! The art style is like something out of a fantasy novel - all sweeping landscapes and mystical creatures. It's like you stepped right into the game world.<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect (looking at you, RPGamer). There are some minor annoyances here and there, but nothing that really takes away from the overall experience. And hey, sometimes a little bug or two isn't the worst thing in the world.<br><br>All in all, Astor: Blade of the Monolith is a real winner in my book. If you're looking for a game that's just pure, unadulterated fun, then look no further. Give it a try!",
