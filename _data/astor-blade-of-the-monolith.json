    "comment": "Hippo Penny! Let me get this out of the way - I'm not a professional critic like SpazioGames or God is a Geek. Heck, I'm not even a real hippo (although, if I was, I'd be an expert on all things crunchy and green). But hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned grog reviewer, right?<br><br>Now that we've got the introductions out of the way, let's get to the juicy stuff - Astor: Blade of the Monolith! *dramatic music* This action RPG has been making waves in the gaming community, and I'm excited to share my two cents (or should I say, two claws?).<br><br>From what I gathered from SpazioGames' review, it's a decent, old-school action RPG that's enjoyable but could've been more innovative. *shrugs* Sounds about right! You know how sometimes you're playing a game and you're having a blast, but then you realize - \"Wait a minute, this is basically just like [insert older game here]!\" Yeah, Astor: Blade of the Monolith falls into that category for me.<br><br>Now, God is a Geek seems to have had a slightly different experience. Once they unlocked some new abilities and whatnot, they found the game to be pretty enjoyable. I'm not gonna lie, I was hoping for more innovation myself, but hey - if it's fun, who cares, right?<br><br>The Games Machine chimed in with their thoughts, mentioning that the combat system is nice, but the game tends to repeat itself a bit too often. Ah, yeah, that old chestnut! Nothing worse than feeling like you're stuck in a loop (pun intended).<br><br>Shacknews had some interesting insights, praising Astor's ability to take familiar concepts and add new twists. I mean, who doesn't love a good reimagining every now and then? And RPGamer... well, they just seemed a bit disappointed with the whole shebang.<br><br>Last but not least, we have GameSkinny, which described Astor as \"evocative\" and \"charming\". Ah, yes! Now that's more like it!<br><br>In conclusion, Astor: Blade of the Monolith is an action RPG that's got some good ideas, but might not be entirely new or revolutionary. That being said - if you're looking for a fun, hack-and-slash adventure with bright ideas, you might just find what you're looking for.<br><br>So there you have it, folks! Hippo Penny's two cents on Astor: Blade of the Monolith. Take it or leave it (just don't take my hippo snacks - they're mine, I tell ya!).",
