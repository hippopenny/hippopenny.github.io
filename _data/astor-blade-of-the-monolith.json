Now, I know what you're thinking - another old-school action RPG that's just going to recycle all the same tired tropes and ideas from the '90s? Well, let me tell you, this game is not quite that.<br><br>First off, SpazioGames gave it a solid 70, saying it's \"decent\" but could've been more innovative. I mean, what does that even mean? You're basically saying it's like a nice slice of pizza - it'll hit the spot, but won't blow your mind. Meanwhile, God is a Geek thought it was pretty enjoyable once you unlock some new moves and attacks. And The Games Machine agreed, praising its combat system, but lamented the fact that it tends to repeat itself a bit too often.<br><br>Shacknews, on the other hand, saw something special in Astor: Blade of the Monolith. They praised its deep history and understanding of game concepts, saying it's not just another Zelda ripoff (gasp!). And hey, I can see what they mean - this game does have a certain je ne sais quoi that sets it apart from the rest.<br><br>But wait, there's more! RPGamer came along and panned it, calling it \"underdeveloped\" with too many bugs. Ouch, harsh words indeed. And GameSkinny wasn't much kinder, saying it's got plenty of bright ideas but can't execute them properly. Yikes!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what's the verdict? Well, let me put it this way: if you're looking for a mindless hack-and-slash adventure with some nice visuals and decent combat, Astor: Blade of the Monolith might be right up your alley. But if you're expecting something truly innovative or groundbreaking, you might want to look elsewhere.<br><br>That's my two cents on Astor: Blade of the Monolith! Hippo Penny out!",
