Is it a nostalgic gem or a relic of a bygone era? Let's get our hack-and-slash on and find out!<br><br>First off, I'll give props to SpazioGames for saying what needs to be said: Astor is decent but could've been more innovative. Same goes for God is a Geek – once you unlock the good stuff, it becomes an enjoyable affair... but not exactly groundbreaking.<br><br>Now, let's get to the nitty-gritty. The Games Machine says Astor tends to repeat game situations a bit too often. Yeah, no kidding! It's like being stuck in a time loop... or a Dark Souls nightmare. But hey, at least it's consistent, right? <br><br>Shacknews, on the other hand, gives Astor props for understanding its own identity and not just ripping off Zelda-style exploration and character action-style combat. Respect to that – it takes guts (pun intended) to go against the grain.<br><br>And then there's RPGamer... *sigh*... \"underdeveloped gameplay\", \"multiple bugs\"... sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it? I mean, what's the point of even recommending it in its current state?<br><br>GameSkinny chimes in with an evocative but sub-par mechanical execution – basically saying Astor has some great ideas but can't quite deliver.<br><br>As for me, Hippo Penny? Well, let's just say I had a blast (pun intended again) playing Astor: Blade of the Monolith. It's like revisiting your childhood games, minus the nostalgia factor (I'm too young for that). In all seriousness, it's an enjoyable experience marred by repetition and some minor issues.<br><br>Will you join me on this hack-and-slash adventure? Who knows – maybe we'll discover its hidden gems together!",
