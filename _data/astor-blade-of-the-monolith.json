Well, maybe not everyone, but some critics are certainly making their voices heard.<br><br>Let me start by saying that Astor is a game that knows its roots. It's like a retro-fueled hot rod, blasting down the highway with a VHS-tape-wormhole soundtrack playing in the background. The combat system is reminiscent of old-school Zelda games, and I'm not mad at it – in fact, I rather enjoy the nostalgia trip.<br><br>Now, before we get into the nitty-gritty of whether Astor: Blade of the Monolith is a \"good\" game or not (spoiler alert: it's a solid B- effort), let's take a look at what the critics are saying. SpazioGames gave it a 70, praising its old-school charm but lamenting its lack of innovation. God is a Geek concurred, stating that once you unlock some sweet moves, Astor becomes an enjoyable ride. The Games Machine echoed these sentiments, adding that the game tends to repeat itself a bit too much.<br><br>Shacknews, on the other hand, took a more nuanced approach, praising Astor's ability to iterate on familiar concepts and create something new (if not entirely perfect). And then there's RPGamer, which essentially told Astor to go back to its mommy, stating that it feels underdeveloped, buggy, and plot-wise, in need of some serious punching up.<br><br>Lastly, GameSkinny gave it a 60, saying that while Astor has plenty of bright ideas, the mechanical execution leaves something to be desired. I'm not sure if I should be impressed or disappointed – maybe a little bit of both?<br><br>So, what's the takeaway from all these reviews? Well, for starters, Astor: Blade of the Monolith is definitely an action RPG that knows its strengths and weaknesses. If you're looking for a fun, hack-and-slash adventure with some retro flair, you might enjoy it. Just don't expect too much innovation or polish.<br><br>And hey, if all else fails, there's always the chance that Astor will learn from its mistakes and come back with an improved sequel (or three). After all, as Shacknews so astutely pointed out, iteration is key in game development – just ask Nintendo.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny says: Astor: Blade of the Monolith is a solid B- effort. If you're down for some old-school action RPG goodness with a dash of charm and whimsy, then go ahead and give it a try. Just don't say I didn't warn you when you encounter some minor frustrations along the way.<br><br>Stay tuned, folks! Next time, I'll be diving into [insert game name here] – or maybe not, depending on whether I can get my paws on a working copy.",
