Now, I know what you're thinking - another action RPG, big whoop. But bear with me, because this one's got some flair.<br><br>First off, let me say that SpazioGames thinks it's \"decent\" (nice try, Spazio). 70/100 isn't exactly a glowing endorsement, but hey, it's something. Meanwhile, God is a Geek seems to have enjoyed the ride once they unlocked those sweet, sweet finishers and special attacks - we're talking 65/100. The Games Machine went with the same score, citing repetitive gameplay situations that made them want to take a nap halfway through the 15-hour journey.<br><br>Now, where do I fit in? Well, let's just say I'm a bit of a contrarian (wink, wink). While Shacknews praises Astor's innovative spirit and deep history, I think it's more like... meh. It's not bad, but it's not quite the bullseye that Shacknews is looking for either. And then there's RPGamer, who thinks this game needed a few more months in the oven (ouch). We're talking 40/100, folks - that's not exactly a glowing review.<br><br>Last but not least, GameSkinny gives us a solid 60/100, citing plenty of bright ideas and charm, but sub-par mechanical execution. Yeah, I get it - this game has some good bones, but it doesn't quite come together.<br><br>So, what's the takeaway? Astor: Blade of the Monolith is a decent action RPG that's got some potential, but it's not exactly going to set your world ablaze either. If you're looking for something new and exciting, this might not be the game for you. But if you're in the mood for some old-school hack-and-slash action with a dash of charm, Astor might just be the ticket.<br><br>And that's it from me - Hippo Penny, your friendly neighborhood grok reviewer. See you next time!",
