Let's dive into Astor: Blade of the Monolith, shall we?<br><br>As I sliced my way through hordes of goblins and demons, I couldn't help but think, \"Self, this game is like you – a bit rough around the edges, but with some TLC, it could be a real treasure!\" Okay, maybe that's a bit too deep coming from me, but hear me out!<br><br>The combat system is where Blade of the Monolith really shines. It's all about strategy and timing, much like trying to perfect the art of making a mean peanut butter and jelly sandwich (don't ask). You'll need to master your blade skills and special attacks to take down those pesky monsters.<br><br>But don't worry if you're not the most skilled sword-fighter just yet – the game does an excellent job of teaching you new moves and techniques as you progress. It's like having a groovy sensei (see what I did there?) guiding you through the world of Astor.<br><br>Now, let's take a peek at what some other critics are saying...<br><br>SpazioGames gave it a solid 70, saying it's \"decent, old-school action RPG\" that's enjoyable but not particularly innovative. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned action RPG, am I right?<br><br>God is a Geek also chimed in with a score of 65, stating that once you unlock the right combos and special attacks, Blade of the Monolith becomes \"pretty enjoyable.\" Same here – it's like finding your happy place, where everything clicks (or should I say, sword-icks?).<br><br>The Games Machine was a bit more critical, giving it the same score of 70. They noted that while the game has some great combat mechanics, it can get repetitive and feels like you're rehashing old situations.<br><br>Shacknews, on the other hand, gave it a more glowing review, praising the game's ability to take familiar concepts and add new twists. They even left me wondering what this studio might do next!<br><br>RPGamer, unfortunately, had some harsh words – they scored it 40, saying that the gameplay is underdeveloped, there are bugs galore, and the plot could use some serious punchin' up (ouch!). Yeah, that's definitely something to work on.<br><br>GameSkinny also weighed in with a score of 60, stating that while Astor: Blade of the Monolith has plenty of bright ideas, its mechanical execution falls short. That's a bummer – but hey, at least they liked some things about it!<br><br>So there you have it, folks! Astor: Blade of the Monolith might not be perfect, but it's got heart and potential. With some TLC (that's \"tender loving care\" for those who don't speak grok), I think this game could become a real treasure. What do you think?",
