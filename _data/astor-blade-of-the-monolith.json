But hold up, folks, because this one has some bite... or at least, it tries to.<br><br>Let me start by saying that SpazioGames was all like \"it's decent\" and God is a Geek chimed in with \"once you unlock the good stuff, it gets enjoyable.\" Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. The game starts off slow, but then it's like, hey, I'm having fun! But don't get too excited, because The Games Machine was all like \"it repeats itself\" and we're left wondering if that repetition is a good thing or a bad thing.<br><br>Now, Shacknews gets all poetic on me and says Astor: Blade of the Monolith takes familiar concepts and makes them new again. And honestly, I get what they mean. It's like when you play an old Zelda game and it feels fresh because of its nostalgia factor. But let's be real, Shacknews is being too kind here.

And IGN France just gives it a solid, honest thumbs up. So, what's the verdict? Well, I'll leave that up to you, dear reader. All I know is that Hippo Penny is all about having fun, and Astor: Blade of the Monolith is no exception.<br><br>So, grab your sword (or in this case, Astor), and let's get slashing!",
