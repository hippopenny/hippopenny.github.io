Let me tell you, it's been a wild ride getting to this point.<br><br>First off, I gotta say, SpazioGames gets a gold star for being the most optimistic reviewer out there. \"Decent, old-school action RPG\"... okay, sure thing! You get what you pay for (free games, am I right?). Astor: Blade of the Monolith is like that one cousin at the family reunion – it's got its moments, but ultimately, it's just trying to fit in.<br><br>God is a Geek took a different route, saying the game becomes \"enjoyable\" once you unlock some sweet moves. Now, I ain't gonna lie, getting those sweet, sweet finishers and special attacks does make the experience more... tolerable. It's like when your significant other finally gets that one thing you've been asking for – it's a small win!<br><br>The Games Machine got all serious on us, complaining about repetition in gameplay. You know what? They're right! I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned Groundhog Day scenario? \"Okay, let me just fight this same boss again... and again... and again...\" Ah, memories!<br><br>Now, Shacknews is the real MVP here. They actually get it – they see that Astor: Blade of the Monolith is trying to do something new and innovative (albeit with a few stumbles). It's like when you finally find that one game that \"gets\" you, you know?<br><br>And then there's RPGamer... *sigh* Yeah, those folks got some tough love for this game. Underdeveloped gameplay, bugs galore – it's like they're saying, \"Hey, we see potential in you, Astor, but you gotta step up your game (literally)!\" <br><br>Lastly, GameSkinny is the cool kid on the block, saying Astor: Blade of the Monolith has bright ideas but poor execution. Yeah, I can get behind that – it's like when you're all stoked about a new restaurant only to find out their food is meh.<br><br>So there you have it, folks! My review of Astor: Blade of the Monolith – it's a game that's got its good moments, but ultimately needs some work. But hey, what's the point of gaming if we can't have some fun, right?",
