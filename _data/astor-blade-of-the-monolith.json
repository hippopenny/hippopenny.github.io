Now, I know what you're thinking - another critic trying to make sense of a game that's just okay. But fear not, my friends, because I'm about to dive in and tell it like it is.<br><br>First off, let me say that Astor: Blade of the Monolith isn't a bad game by any stretch. It's got some cool ideas, like its exploration-based combat system and some neat visuals. But, oh boy, does it suffer from repetition. I mean, I get it - games need to be fun, right? But when you're fighting the same monsters over and over again with barely any variation, it gets old fast.<br><br>Now, some of my fellow critics might say that's just part of the charm. SpazioGames called it a \"decent, old-school action RPG\" that's enjoyable but could've been more innovative. And God is a Geek said that once you unlock enough weapons and special attacks, the game becomes pretty enjoyable. I get what they're saying - there's some fun to be had here.<br><br>But let me tell you, friends, this game has its problems. The Games Machine pointed out that it tends to repeat situations a little too often, which can get frustrating. And Shacknews said that while Astor does a great job of taking familiar concepts and adding new context, the gameplay is just not quite there yet.<br><br>And then there's RPGamer, who basically threw in the towel on this one. They said the game feels underdeveloped, with multiple bugs and a plot that needed some serious punching up. Now, I get it - nobody likes a game that's buggy or has poor storytelling. But let me tell you, folks, even I found myself having a bit of fun despite all the flaws.<br><br>So here's my take: Astor: Blade of the Monolith is like that one friend who's always trying to make you laugh, but sometimes just can't quite hit the mark. It's got some cool ideas, it's got some charm, but sometimes it gets stuck in a rut and needs to shake things up.<br><br>All right, so what do I recommend? Well, if you're an action RPG fan who doesn't mind a little repetition, then sure - give Astor: Blade of the Monolith a try. But if you're looking for something with some serious depth or innovation, you might want to keep on looking. GameSkinny said it's an evocative and charming hack-and-slash adventure, but even they had to admit that the mechanical execution is sub-par.<br><br>And there you have it, folks - my two cents on Astor: Blade of the Monolith. It's not a bad game by any stretch, but it needs some work before it can really shine. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go play something else that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out in frustration. Later, gamers!",
