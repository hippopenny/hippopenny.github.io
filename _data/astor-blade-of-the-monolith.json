Well, not everyone, but SpazioGames and God is a Geek seem to think it's decent enough (70/65 scores, respectively). Meanwhile, The Games Machine and Shacknews are all about the combat system – but, let me tell you, it's not without its flaws.<br><br>As I sliced and diced my way through hordes of baddies, I couldn't help but think that Astor has some serious Zelda vibes going on. That's right, folks – this game is like a spiritual successor to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time ( minus the time-traveling, of course). And you know what? It's actually kind of awesome!<br><br>But don't get me wrong; it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I mean, RPGamer pretty much tore this game apart with a 40 score – and honestly, I can see why. The gameplay feels a bit underdeveloped, like they left some crucial polish off in the development process (see what I did there?). And don't even get me started on the bugs – it was like playing a beta version of the game!<br><br>Now, I know GameSkinny gave it a 60 and said it's \"evocative and charming,\" but let's be real – that score is all about the bright ideas and charm (read: potential). And hey, who doesn't love a good hack-and-slash adventure?<br><br>In conclusion, Astor: Blade of the Monolith is a fun little romp that's got some great bones beneath the surface. It's like a rough diamond waiting to be polished – or, you know, just a decent game that could use some improvement. <br><br>Time for me to put my reviewing skills where my mouth is and give it a go!",
