Now, I know what you're thinking - another action RPG trying to carve its niche in the vast digital landscape? But fear not, young adventurers! This review is all about highlighting the good, the bad, and the utterly bewildering in this retro-fueled romp.<br><br>First off, let's give credit where credit is due: Astor: Blade of the Monolith does old-school action RPG right. Imagine a love child born from the marriage of Diablo's dark fantasy and The Legend of Zelda's... well, legendary-ness. Yeah, it's that kind of game! You'll hack, slash, and sorcery-sling your way through hordes of baddies, all while uncovering the mysteries behind Astor's world.<br><br>Now, onto the critics! SpazioGames gave us a solid 70, praising the game for its decent combat system and enjoyable experience. God is a Geek echoed those sentiments, saying once you unlock enough toys, this game becomes quite the time-waster (in a good way, of course). The Games Machine also chimed in with a similar score, noting that while it's not without flaws, Astor: Blade of the Monolith has its charm.<br><br>On the flip side, Shacknews dug deeper and discovered that beneath the surface lies an impressive understanding of gaming history - kudos to Astor for not just copying, but genuinely innovating within the genre. However, RPGamer sadly deemed it \"a game that needed a few more months to cook,\" citing underdeveloped gameplay, bugs galore, and a plot in desperate need of... well, punching up (ouch!).<br><br>Lastly, GameSkinny brought the heat with its 60-point review, praising Astor's charm but lamenting sub-par execution. Guess we can agree that this game is all about evoking memories of yesteryear's hack-and-slashers.<br><br>So what's my take on Astor: Blade of the Monolith? Well, Hippo Penny has a special spot in its heart for games that nail the retro vibe. While it's not perfect - who is?! - this game has enough bite (heh) to keep you coming back for more. It's your call whether to join me on this wild ride or not.<br><br>Stay groovy, fellow gamers!",
