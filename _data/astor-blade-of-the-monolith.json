Now, I know what you're thinking - another action RPG with a cool-sounding name? Yeah, yeah, yeah... But stick around, folks, because this one's got some bite (get it?).<br><br>First off, let me say that Astor has got some serious Zelda vibes going on. Exploration, combat, the whole shebang! But instead of being just another Zelda clone, Blade of the Monolith adds its own flair with some seriously cool action elements. I mean, who doesn't love a good combo attack or five?<br><br>Now, I know SpazioGames gave it a solid 70, saying it's \"decent\" and all that jazz. And you know what? They're not wrong! It's definitely an enjoyable romp. But don't get me started on God is a Geek - they think the game gets good once you unlock some decent gear... like, hello, that's half the game! What about the other 14.5 hours, folks?<br><br>The Games Machine had some issues with repetition, saying it feels like you're doing the same thing over and over again. And you know what? I kinda agree. It's like they're trying to make me feel all... groggy.<br><br>But hey, at least Shacknews gave it some props for being innovative and all that jazz. They even used the word \"impressive\"! High praise from those folks!<br><br>And then there's RPGamer - oh boy, are they harsh! Underdeveloped gameplay, bugs galore, and a plot that needs some serious punching up? Yikes! I mean, come on, guys! It's not all bad... right?<br><br>GameSkinny chimed in with the whole \"evocative and charming\" thing, but hey, at least they admitted the mechanics were sub-par. So yeah, that's my take - it's got some good stuff going on, but needs a bit more work. And honestly? That's not so bad!<br><br>So what are you waiting for? Go grab Astor: Blade of the Monolith and see what all the fuss is about!",
