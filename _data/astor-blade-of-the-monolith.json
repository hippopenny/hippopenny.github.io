As a seasoned reviewer (ahem, okay, I'm still getting the hang of this whole \"seasoned\" thing), I'll give you the lowdown on what makes this game tick.<br><br>First off, let me just say that Astor: Blade of the Monolith is all about nostalgia – it's like a big ol' bowl of retro gaming goodness. You've got your old-school action RPG vibes, mixed with some modern twists and turns. The combat system? It's like a dance party for your eyes (and your reflexes)! You'll be slicing and dicing baddies left and right, unlocking new moves and attacks as you progress.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – what about the critics? Well, SpazioGames gave it a decent 70, saying it's \"enjoyable but could have been more innovative.\" God is a Geek chimed in with a similar score, noting that once you've got the right gear and moves, Astor becomes \"pretty enjoyable.\" The Games Machine echoed this sentiment, mentioning that while the combat system is nice, the game tends to repeat itself a bit too much.<br><br>Shacknews, on the other hand, took a more glowing approach. They praised Astor's ability to take familiar concepts and make them fresh again, calling it an impressive feat of game development. And then there's RPGamer, who was less impressed – they felt like the gameplay was underdeveloped, with too many bugs and not enough plot punch.<br><br>Lastly, GameSkinny gave it a 60, saying that while Astor has plenty of bright ideas, its mechanical execution is sub-par. Hmm, mixed bag, much?<br><br>So, what's my take on Astor: Blade of the Monolith? Well, I think it's a fun ride, but not without its flaws. The combat system is where it's at (pun intended), and if you can look past some of the repetition and minor bugs, you'll find yourself having a blast. And hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned hack-and-slash adventure?<br><br>In conclusion, Astor: Blade of the Monolith is like that one cool cousin at the gaming family reunion – it's not perfect, but it's got its charm. So go ahead, give it a try, and see what all the fuss is about!",
