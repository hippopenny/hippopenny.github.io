I'm here to dish out the scoop on Astor: Blade of the Monolith, a game that's got everyone talking (well, not everyone, but you know what I mean). Let's get down to business and see if this old-school action RPG is worth your time.<br><br>First off, I've gotta give props to SpazioGames for saying it's \"decent\" and all, but come on, folks! That's like calling a unicorn a decent horse. Astor: Blade of the Monolith is more than just decent; it's a wild ride that'll keep you entertained for hours on end.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the combat system?\" Ah, yes! The games machine (aha!) raved about it, saying it's nice and all. And yeah, it's pretty cool. But let's be real, folks; after a while, it does start to feel like Groundhog Day â€“ same ol' situations, different day.<br><br>But hey, that's not the only thing going on here! Shacknews gave props for Astor's ability to take familiar concepts and make them fresh again (like putting new wine in old bottles... or something). I mean, who doesn't love a good character action-style combat? It's like a breath of fresh air!<br><br>RPGamer, on the other hand, was like the party pooper, saying it needed more cooking time. And yeah, there are some bugs and whatnot, but come on! The plot could use some punchin' up too, right?<br><br>GameSkinny chimed in with a review that's basically saying Astor: Blade of the Monolith has bright ideas, but they just didn't quite pan out mechanically.<br><br>So, what's my takeaway? Well, let's just say I had more fun playing this game than SpazioGames did writing their review. And hey, if you're looking for a fun hack-and-slash adventure with some bright ideas (but not-so-great execution), then Astor: Blade of the Monolith might be up your alley!<br><br>That's it for now! Hippo Penny signing off!",
