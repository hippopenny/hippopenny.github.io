Now, I know what you're thinking - what's the scoop, man? Well, let me tell you, it's a wild ride with some cool combat mechanics, but it's not without its quirks.<br><br>First off, SpazioGames gives it a 70, saying it's decent and enjoyable, but could've been more innovative. I mean, fair enough - innovation is key in the gaming world! God is a Geek chimes in with a similar score, praising the game for being enjoyable once you unlock some sweet moves. The Games Machine agrees, noting that Astor's combat system is nice, but the repetition gets old after a while.<br><br>Now, Shacknews takes it up a notch, highlighting the game's impressive sense of iteration (nerd speak for \"borrowing\" cool ideas and making them fresh). They praise its unique blend of exploration and combat, even if it doesn't quite hit the bullseye. And then there's RPGamer, who gives it a harsh 40, citing underdeveloped gameplay, bugs galore, and a plot that needs some serious punch-ups.<br><br>GameSkinny wraps it up with a 60, saying it's an evocative and charming game, but mechanically sub-par. Ouch, tough love!<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, let me put on my critical thinking cap (it looks like a hippo's face, FYI). Astor: Blade of the Monolith is a solid attempt at blending old-school RPG goodness with some modern flair. It's got its moments - I mean, who doesn't love some sweet combat and exploration? But it also has some rough edges, like repetition and underdeveloped mechanics.<br><br>In conclusion (see what I did there?), Astor: Blade of the Monolith is a decent, if not entirely remarkable, action RPG. If you're down for some old-school goodness with some modern twists, this might be the game for you. Just don't expect too much innovation or a completely bug-free experience.",
