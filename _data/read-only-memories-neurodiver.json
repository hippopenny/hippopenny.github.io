This game has got some serious geek cred, and I'm here for it!<br><br>Let me tell you, folks, this game is a wild ride. You play as ES88, a cyberpunk detective on a mission to find the Golden Butterfly, a mystical artifact that can change the course of human history. Sounds serious, right? But trust me, the tone is more \"cyber-punk-edy\" than \"serious-ious\".<br><br>The gameplay is where things get really fun. Imagine a choose-your-own-adventure book come to life, but instead of flipping pages, you're hacking into mainframes and cracking codes like a pro! It's a blast, folks, and I'm not just saying that because I spent 12 hours straight playing this game (don't judge me).<br><br>Now, let's talk about the critics. Slant Magazine gave it a score of 60, saying it's got immense creative potential but doesn't quite deliver. God is a Geek gave it a 95, calling it a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\". I think they're onto something there!<br><br>RPG Fan gave it a 78, saying it left them feeling unsatisfied. And Noisy Pixel scored it a 70, praising the fun story and lovable characters but noting some disappointing moments. Shacknews scored it a 90, praising its pitch-perfect execution and western anime fandom. Gamers Heroes gave it an 85, saying it's a fantastic futuristic experience.<br><br>Checkpoint Gaming scored it a lowly 65, citing lack of freedom and unsatisfying conclusions. Okay, I get it, they wanted more from this game! But honestly, folks, that's what makes NEURODIVER so charming – its imperfections make it all the more endearing.<br><br>So, is Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER a must-play? Heck yeah, it is! If you're a fan of cyberpunk, anime, or just want to experience something new and exciting, this game's got your back. Just don't expect perfection – but hey, who does?<br><br>That's my Hippo Penny review of Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER! See you in the next one, folks!",
