As someone who's all about having fun and making snarky remarks, I'm excited to see if this game lives up to its hype.<br><br>First off, let me just say that the premise is wild. You play as ES88, a detective trying to solve a mystery in a futuristic world where AI has taken over. It's like someone took Blade Runner, added a dash of PC gaming nostalgia, and then sprinkled it with anime flair. I mean, who wouldn't want to explore this weird and wonderful world?<br><br>But enough about the setting – let's talk gameplay! NEURODIVER is all about exploration, puzzle-solving, and chatting up characters (because nothing says \"cyberpunk\" like a good ol' fashioned chat). And honestly? It's a blast. The puzzles are clever, the dialogue is witty, and the atmosphere is electric.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But Hippo Penny, what about the critics?\" Ah, yes! Let me tell you, some of these folks have got it rough. Slant Magazine says the game is \"embarrassed\" by its creative options? Um, isn't that a good thing? And don't even get me started on Checkpoint Gaming's review – \"underwhelming and disappointing\"? Come on, guys! NEURODIVER might not be perfect, but it's certainly an enjoyable ride.<br><br>In fact, I think most critics agree: the game's got heart, it's got style, and it's got a whole lot of fun to offer. God is a Geek says it's a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\" – I couldn't agree more! And even Noisy Pixel, who seems disappointed by some of the game's shortcomings, still calls it a \"net positive experience\".<br><br>So, what's my take on NEURODIVER? Well, let me just say that it's a wild ride. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth your time and attention. If you're looking for a fun, quirky cyberpunk romp with some awesome characters and puzzles to solve, then look no further!",
