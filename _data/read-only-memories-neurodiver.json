Get ready to dive into the world of Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER, where sci-fi meets anime flair and mystery abounds!<br><br>As I embark on this review adventure, I can't help but wonder: what's all the fuss about? Are the critics just too cool for school, or is Neurodiver really as rad as they claim?<br><br>Let's start with Slant Magazine, who gave it a score of 60. Apparently, Neurodiver had some huge creative opportunities that just didn't pan out. I mean, I've been there - sometimes even the best ideas don't quite come together.<br><br>Then there's God is a Geek, who raved about this game, calling it \"a wonderful sci-fi romp.\" Yeah, no kidding! I'm sold already!<br><br>RPG Fan seems a bit more mixed, scoring Neurodiver at 78. They liked the game but felt it left them feeling unsatisfied. I get it - sometimes you need that extra something to make it all worthwhile.<br><br>Noisy Pixel chimes in with a score of 70, praising the visuals and gameplay concept while expressing some disappointment. That's like me when my favorite snack runs out!<br><br>Shacknews scores Neurodiver at 90, saying it's a \"pitch-perfect execution\" on its premise. I'm all about that perfect blend of sci-fi and anime vibes! A little more narrative depth would've made it even better, but hey, who doesn't love a good mystery?<br><br>Gamers Heroes gives Neurodiver an 85, calling it \"a fantastic futuristic experience.\" I agree - there's something so captivating about exploring this world!<br><br>Lastly, Checkpoint Gaming scores Neurodiver at 65, stating that it falls short of its predecessor. I'm not one to compare games (okay, maybe a little), but even with some issues, Neurodiver still has plenty to offer.<br><br>So, what's the takeaway? Well, read-only memories can be pretty darn cool! Don't let me or anyone else scare you off - give Neurodiver a try and see for yourself!<br><br>That's it for now! Hippo Penny out!",
