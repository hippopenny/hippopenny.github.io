As a seasoned grok video game reviewer, I'm always up for a challenge - and this one looks like it's got some serious sci-fi cred going on.<br><br>First off, let me just say that I love how all these other critics are getting their knickers in a twist over the lack of \"creative options\" or whatever. Like, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned cyberpunk romp with some ancient PC tech and western anime flair? Sounds like a party to me!<br><br>Now, on to the review! NEURODIVER's got some serious style going on - I mean, have you seen those visuals?! They're straight out of a retro-futurist fever dream. The characters are all sorts of charming, from ES88's detective vibes to the Golden Butterfly herself (because who doesn't love a good mythical creature? . And the story? Oh boy, it's got some major feels going on.<br><br>But here's the thing: I think all these other critics might be missing the point. NEURODIVER's not about being the most ambitious or daring game out there; it's about having fun with its world and characters. And trust me, that's exactly what you'll get if you dive in. It's like a warm hug for your brain - all fuzzy and comfortable.<br><br>Now, I know some of my fellow critics are saying that NEURODIVER feels \"underwhelming\" or \"disappointing\". But I'm here to tell you that those folks just don't understand the magic of this little game. It's not about breaking new ground; it's about being a darn good time.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a quick, queer-friendly romp with some seriously stylish visuals and an adorable cast of characters - then NEURODIVER is the game for you! Just don't go in expecting to be blown away by groundbreaking gameplay or world-changing narratives. Sometimes, it's just about having a good time with some old-fashioned fun.<br><br>That's all from me this time around, folks! Hippo Penny, signing off with a big ol' thumbs up for NEURODIVER!",
