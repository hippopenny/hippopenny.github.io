You know, the one who shows up late, wears a weird hat, and tries to make everyone laugh with their dad jokes? Yeah, that's what this game is.<br><br>But seriously, folks, NEURODIVER has some real charm to it. The visuals are straight-up stunning, like someone took all the best parts of 90s anime and mixed 'em with some good ol' cyberpunk flair. And those characters! ES88's got some quirky, lovable friends that'll make you want to join their futuristic shindig.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, why so many mixed signals?\" Well, let me tell you - this game is like trying to hug a cat. It's all about the vibes, baby! Sometimes it's all sunshine and rainbows (read: those lovable characters), while other times it's like getting hit with a wet sock (read: the puzzles... more on that later).<br><br>But hey, at least Slant Magazine wasn't too hard on 'em - 60 ain't bad! God is a Geek thought it was a sci-fi romp to be reckoned with, and I'm inclined to agree. Gamers Heroes even gave it a solid 85! That's like... that's like giving a participation trophy to a game that knows how to participate (get it?).<br><br>Now, the critics didn't always see eye-to-eye - RPG Fan was all about that uncertainty vibe, saying the game left them feeling unsatisfied. Checkpoint Gaming thought it fell short of its predecessor, 20XX: Read Only Memories (I mean, who doesn't love a good sequel?). Noisy Pixel felt like there were some poorly handled parts... yikes!<br><br>Me? I'm just here for the fun! NEURODIVER's got that cyberpunk charm, and those lovable characters. Yeah, it might not be perfect, but hey, at least Shacknews said it was \"a dope slice of niche gaming\"!<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Hippo Penny says: if you're looking for a futuristic romp with some quirky friends, NEURODIVER's your game! Just don't expect too much from those puzzles...",
