With its neon-lit aesthetic and retro-futuristic vibe, this game has all the makings of a cult classic. But let's get to the good stuff - what about the gameplay?<br><br>As ES88, you're on a mission to find that Golden Butterfly, and along the way, you'll encounter a bunch of lovable characters who are just as quirky as they are cool. The story's got some nice surprises, and the world-building is top-notch. But where things get iffy is with the puzzles - don't get me wrong, I love a good challenge, but some of these brain teasers feel like they were written by an 80s game designer trying to be edgy (i.e., too easy).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the critics? Well, let's just say they're not exactly in agreement on this one. Slant Magazine thinks it's a creative embarrassment waiting to happen, while God is a Geek calls it a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\" (I'm with them on that one). RPG Fan and Noisy Pixel are a bit more mixed - they like the game but feel like something was missing. And then there's Checkpoint Gaming, who thinks it falls short of its predecessor (20XX: Read Only Memories, anyone?).<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, I think NEURODIVER is a fun, if flawed, adventure that's got some great ideas and even better characters. It's not perfect by any stretch, but hey, who doesn't love a good retro-futuristic romp? If you're looking for something to spice up your gaming routine, this might be the ticket. Just don't expect too much depth, or you might find yourself feeling like you've got a bad case of the Mondays.<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find that Golden Butterfly!",
