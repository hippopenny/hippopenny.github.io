With all the hype surrounding it, I was eager to see if ES88's latest adventure would live up to its promise.<br><br>First off, let me just say that the visuals in this game are top-notch! The futuristic setting is so stunningly designed, it's like stepping into an anime episode come to life. And those characters? Absolutely lovable! You'll find yourself swooning over ES88's quirky crew and getting invested in their stories.<br><br>Now, about those stories... While some critics might say that NEURODIVER falls short on the narrative front (cough, cough, Slant Magazine), I think it's got a great balance of humor, heart, and sci-fi goodness. The world-building is so immersive that you'll want to explore every nook and cranny.<br><br>Of course, not everyone shares my enthusiasm. Some critics have pointed out the game's lack of freedom or its simplistic puzzle design (hello, Noisy Pixel!). And yeah, maybe those elements do leave a bit to be desired. BUT, in my humble opinion, NEURODIVER makes up for it with its sheer charm and addictive gameplay.<br><br>So, will you fall head over heels for Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER? If you're a fan of quirky characters, stunning visuals, and an entertaining sci-fi romp, then absolutely! But if you're looking for something more complex or meaty narrative-wise... well, that's a different story (see what I did there?). In any case, it's worth giving NEURODIVER a shot.",
