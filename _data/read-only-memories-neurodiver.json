Now, let's dive into the fun-filled world of NEURODIVER and see what this cyberpunk romp has in store for us!<br><br>As I booted up the game, I was immediately struck by its visually stunning art style - think anime-inspired futuristic landscapes with a dash of 90s nostalgia. The character designs are equally impressive, with ES88's lovable bunch of misfits and outcasts stealing the show (or should I say, the Golden Butterfly?). The world-building is top-notch, too, dropping you into a richly detailed cyberpunk setting that's equal parts Blade Runner and Cowboy Bebop.<br><br>Now, let's talk gameplay. NEURODIVER's got some innovative ideas brewing beneath its hood - think hacking mini-games that require quick reflexes and clever problem-solving. The puzzles themselves are satisfyingly challenging without feeling like a chore, making them a blast to tackle (pun intended). Of course, there are the requisite \" Ah, I get it now!\" moments when you finally crack that pesky encryption code or decipher the cryptic clues. It's these little triumphs that make NEURODIVER such an enjoyable ride.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Our esteemed colleagues at Slant Magazine think NEURODIVER has \"an immense, far-reaching embarrassment of creative options\" - a bold claim, indeed. God is a Geek agrees, calling it \"a wonderful sci-fi romp with a story that has to be experienced to be believed.\" And if you're feeling skeptical, Noisy Pixel's take is worth reading: they found the gameplay concept strong and the visuals top-notch, even if some areas fell short.<br><br>Now, I'm not here to rewrite the reviews of my fellow critics (although, let me tell you, it was tempting). Instead, I want to emphasize that NEURODIVER's greatest strength lies in its world-building and characters. ES88's cast is genuinely lovable, with their quirks and flaws making them relatable and memorable. It's these moments of genuine human connection (or at least, cyberpunk-ified simulacrum thereof) that elevate the game beyond mere \"gameplay\" or \"storytelling.\"<br><br>Of course, there are some areas where NEURODIVER stumbles - a few too many fetch quests here, some underwhelming boss battles there. But for every misstep, the game makes up with its sheer enthusiasm and sense of wonder. And when it all comes together? Magic happens, folks! You'll find yourself getting lost in this fantastical world, solving puzzles, and making new friends along the way.<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
