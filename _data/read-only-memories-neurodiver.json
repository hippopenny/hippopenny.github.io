As a seasonal grok video game reviewer with a penchant for witty humor, I'll do my best to make this review both fun and informative.<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm still trying to wrap my head around the premise of NEURODIVER. It's like someone took all my favorite sci-fi tropes – think Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, and a dash of western anime fandom – mixed them together with some PC tech wizardry, and voilà! You get a game that's equal parts thought-provoking and visually stunning.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the critics?\" Ah, yes! The critics. Well, let me tell you, they're a mixed bag, just like any good game should be. From Slant Magazine's lamentable score of 60 to God is a Geek's glowing review of 95, it seems everyone has an opinion on NEURODIVER.<br><br>I'm not here to repeat what the other critics have said, though – I want to add my own two cents to the conversation. In a nutshell, I think NEURODIVER is a game that will leave you feeling... uncertain. Not just because it's trying to tackle some heavy themes and complex ideas, but also because it's got some real ups and downs.<br><br>For every moment that has me swooning over the gorgeous visuals or cheering on the lovable characters, there's another where I'm left scratching my head wondering what just happened or why certain choices felt so underwhelming. It's like the game is trying to be two different things at once – a thrilling adventure and an introspective exploration of identity – and it doesn't always quite succeed.<br><br>But hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing! As someone who's all about embracing the weirdness and unpredictability of life, I appreciate games that don't play by the rules or try to fit neatly into any one genre. NEURODIVER might not be perfect, but it's definitely got some real potential.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a game that'll challenge your perceptions, make you laugh and cry, and maybe even leave you feeling a little confused (in a good way), then NEURODIVER is the game for you! Just don't expect me to give it a perfect score – I'm too busy having fun poking fun at myself and my fellow critics.",
