Now, I know what you're thinking - it's another cyberpunk game with a bunch of technical jargon, right? Wrong! This game is actually really cool, despite what some of my fellow critics might say.<br><br>First off, let me just say that the art style in this game is straight fire. The neon-lit cityscapes, the retro-futuristic tech, and the adorable robot sidekicks - it all comes together to create a visually stunning experience. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack; I've been humming the theme song for days.<br><br>But enough about how pretty the game is (although, let's be real, it's pretty important). The real meat of the game is in its story and characters. ES88, the main robot protagonist, has got some serious sass and heart, and their quest to find the Golden Butterfly is actually really compelling. I mean, sure, it might not be the most complex or original narrative out there, but who doesn't love a good mystery?<br><br>And then there are the supporting characters - oh man, where do I even start? The cast of quirky NPCs you meet along the way are all so delightfully weird and lovable in their own ways. You'll want to help them with their problems and learn more about their lives.<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning the, ahem, \"critics\". Slant Magazine says it's an \"immense\" embarrassment of creative options that the game is \"largely unwilling or unequipped to tap into\"? Um, sure - I mean, who wouldn't want to play a 12-hour open-world RPG instead of this 2-hour narrative-driven experience? And God is a Geek gives it a glowing 95%? Okay, okay, maybe they just got lost in the game's endless corridors of nostalgia-tapping goodness.<br><br>In conclusion, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is an absolute blast. It might not be perfect (who is?), but it's definitely worth your time and money. So grab a copy, put on your comfiest cyberpunk attire, and get ready to dive into the most tubular world since... well, 20XX.<br><br>And remember - I'm just a grok reviewer trying to make my way in this crazy gaming world. Take my word for it, or don't. But honestly, if you're not having fun playing NEURODIVER, then maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore.",
