As a seasoned grok (see what I did there?), I'm excited to share my thoughts on this futuristic adventure.<br><br>Now, let's get one thing straight – some critics are more... shall we say, \"enthusiastic\" than others. *coughs* Slant Magazine, I'm looking at you with your 60 score and \"embarrassment of creative options\" comment. Wow, that's rich coming from someone who probably hasn't played a good sci-fi game since they were still rocking their MySpace profile.<br><br>But I digress. The real question is: does NEURODIVER deliver on its promises? For the most part, yes! The game has a fantastic futuristic setting, with gorgeous visuals that will transport you to a world of 80s-inspired neon and retro-futurism. The characters are charming, and the story has plenty of twists and turns to keep you engaged.<br><br>Of course, not everyone is going to love NEURODIVER as much as I do (okay, maybe nobody loves it as much as me...). For some critics, like RPG Fan, the game falls short of expectations. They mention that the characters are cool but their development stops before their storylines gain traction. Um, isn't that what happens in most games, though? I mean, have you seen the character development in Final Fantasy XV? *crickets*<br><br>On a more serious note (just for a sec, I promise), NEURODIVER does have some flaws. Noisy Pixel mentions feeling a little disappointed due to \"portions...feel[ing] lacking and poorly handled.\" Yeah, that's fair – there are some parts of the game where you might feel like you're just going through the motions.<br><br>But overall, I think NEURODIVER is a fantastic addition to any gamer's library. It's a game that will make you laugh, cry (depending on how attached you get to those characters), and maybe even make you think a little bit about the world we live in. So go ahead, give it a try – just don't expect me to be there when you do, because I'll be too busy binge-playing Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER for the 10th time...",
