This sci-fi romp is all about exploration, nostalgia, and self-discovery, and I'm here for it.<br><br>First off, let me just say that I love how the game takes its time to tell its story. It's like sipping a latte at a quaint café – you want to soak up every moment, savoring the atmosphere and characters. The visuals are top-notch, with neon-lit cityscapes and retro-futuristic vibes that will transport you to a bygone era. And the music? Oh, it's like having your own personal soundtrack to the 80s!<br><br>Now, I know some critics (ahem, Slant Magazine) might say that NEURODIVER doesn't quite live up to its creative potential. But honestly, I think that's just a fancy way of saying \"I'm not cool enough for this retro-futuristic nonsense.\" In all seriousness, the game's limitations are largely due to its ambitious scope and tight narrative constraints.<br><br>But don't let that scare you off! NEURODIVER is still a wild ride with plenty of charm. The characters are lovable, if a tad underdeveloped (RPG Fan, I feel your pain). And those puzzles? Simple yet satisfying – just like solving a retro arcade puzzle game!<br><br>Of course, no one's perfect, not even ES88 themselves. I mean, have you seen that hairdo on ES88's avatar? It's like they stuck their finger in a socket! Okay, okay, I know, that's just me being silly.<br><br>All in all, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is a groovy, nostalgia-fueled adventure that'll transport you to a bygone era of neon-lit nights and retro-futuristic dreams. So grab your Walkman, put on your best 80s-inspired outfit, and get ready to dive into this fabulous world!<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some important grokking to do...",
