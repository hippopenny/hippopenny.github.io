But let's get down to business – I'm not here to give you the full 411 on this game; that's what those other critics are for (more on them later). I'm here to give you the lowdown, with a dash of sass and a pinch of humor.<br><br>First off, let me just say that NEURODIVER has got some serious style going on. The visuals are top-notch, with a futuristic setting that's straight out of a cyberpunk dreamscape. And don't even get me started on the characters – they're so lovable, you'll want to give them all a big hug (or a stern talking-to, depending on your mood).<br><br>Now, let's talk about those other critics. I mean, Slant Magazine says this game is an \"immense, far-reaching embarrassment of creative options that the game is largely either unwilling or unequipped to tap into.\" Ouch, burn! Meanwhile, God is a Geek thinks it's a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\" and gives it a glowing 95. Yeah, I'm pretty sure those two aren't exactly on the same page.<br><br>And then there are the critics who give us some... mixed signals. RPG Fan says that NEURODIVER left them feeling \"uncertain\" – which is code for \"I liked it, but didn't love it.\" Noisy Pixel thinks it's a \"fun, upbeat story\" with lovable characters, but also feels like something was missing. Yeah, I get that vibe too.<br><br>Shacknews gives us some hope, saying that NEURODIVER has a \"pitch-perfect execution on its premise\" and is just one or two tweaks away from being an all-timer. And Gamers Heroes agrees, calling it a \"fantastic futuristic experience.\" Yay, team!<br><br>But let's not forget our resident curmudgeon, Checkpoint Gaming – they're like the fun police of game reviews. They give NEURODIVER a 65 and call it out for being underwhelming and disappointing. Ouch, burn! (Just kidding, I love that guy.)<br><br>All in all, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is a wild ride with some serious ups and downs. But hey, if you're looking for a game that's got style, heart, and some seriously cool characters – then this might just be the one for you.<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
