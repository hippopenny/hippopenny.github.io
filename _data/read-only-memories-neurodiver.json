As I sat down to play this game, I couldn't help but wonder what all the fuss was about. Would it live up to its promise or leave me feeling like I'd just played a mediocre game?<br><br>First off, let me tell you that NEURODIVER has got style in spades. The visuals are top-notch, with a gorgeous futuristic setting and characters that are just begging to be lovable. And, boy, do they deliver! From ES88's charming personality to the quirky cast of characters he meets along the way, there's plenty to smile about here.<br><br>But, as much as I wanted to love this game, I found myself feeling a little... uncertain. Now, don't get me wrong – NEURODIVER has its moments where it really shines. The story is a wild ride, with twists and turns that'll keep you on your toes. And the puzzles? Well, they're no brain-twister, but they're fun in their own way.<br><br>However, I have to agree with some of my fellow critics – this game feels a little... underwhelming at times. Maybe it's because there just isn't enough content here. Or maybe it's because the whole thing feels a bit too short-lived. Whatever the reason, I found myself feeling a little disappointed when the credits rolled.<br><br>So, what do I think of NEURODIVER? Well, let me put it this way: it's like that one friend you have who's always got your back, but sometimes forgets to show up on time. It's not perfect, but it's still a lot of fun. And hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned sci-fi romp every now and then?<br><br>Anyway, I'm gonna wrap this review up like a nice little present (see what I did there?). In short, NEURODIVER is a wild ride that's got style, charm, and plenty of heart. Just don't expect it to blow your mind – at least, not entirely.",
