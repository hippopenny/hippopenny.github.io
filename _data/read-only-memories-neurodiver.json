From what I gathered from the critics (ahem, those fancy folks at Slant Magazine and Noisy Pixel), they were all raving about the game's premise, visuals, and lovable characters. But, being a snarky reviewer, I wanted to see if it truly delivered.<br><br>As I jumped into NEURODIVER, I was initially struck by its vibrant, neon-lit aesthetic. It's like someone poured a can of soda all over the 80s – in a good way! The characters, ES88 and their gang, are charmingly quirky, with designs that border on anime-inspired awesomeness.<br><br>Now, about that premise... As ES88 hunts for the Golden Butterfly (whatever that is), I found myself swept up in the world of cyberpunk nostalgia. Think 1980s-90s throwback vibes mixed with some futuristic flair. It's a wild ride that's equal parts Blade Runner and Tron, but with fewer explosions.<br><br>Here's where things get interesting: NEURODIVER's strength lies in its storytelling. The narrative is expertly woven, with characters that grow on you (even if they don't get the most screen time). I won't spoil the plot, but let's just say it's a wild ride of twists and turns – much like my attempts to make sense of those critics' reviews.<br><br>As for the gameplay? It's... serviceable. I mean, the puzzles are simplistic (Slant Magazine agrees), but that's okay; this game is all about the story and world-building. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book come to life, minus the embarrassment of having to actually read.<br><br>So, what do I think? NEURODIVER's like that one quirky friend who shows up to your party with a weird haircut and an even weirder story – you're not entirely sure why they're there, but you kinda dig it. It may not be perfect (Gamers Heroes and Shacknews, I'm looking at you), but hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned cyberpunk romp every now and then?<br><br>That's my two cents on NEURODIVER – take it for what it's worth!",
