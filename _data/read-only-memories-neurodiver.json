This game is like a wild ride of emotions, with moments that left me feeling all the feels (in a good way). Let's dive in and see what makes NEURODIVER tick!<br><br>First off, the story. Oh boy, where do I even start? It's like being dropped into a sci-fi world of cyberpunk goodness, with ancient PC tech and western anime fandom mixed in. ES88's hunt for the Golden Butterfly is a wild goose chase that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. I loved how the game wove together seemingly disparate threads to create a narrative that's both nostalgic and thought-provoking.<br><br>Now, gameplay-wise, NEURODIVER shines. The puzzles are clever, if not always challenging (I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned pixel-hunt?), and the visuals are straight-up stunning. I mean, have you seen those retro-futuristic cityscapes? It's like being transported to a neon-drenched dreamscape.<br><br>But here's the thing – NEURODIVER isn't without its flaws. Some critics (ahem, Slant Magazine) might say it's \"largely either unwilling or unequipped to tap into\" its full creative potential. I get that; there are moments where the game feels a bit... lacking. But for me, those imperfections only added to the charm.<br><br>I mean, who doesn't love a good underdog story? And let's be real – some of these other critics (cough, cough, Noisy Pixel) might have been expecting too much from NEURODIVER. I mean, it's not like it's trying to reinvent the wheel or anything (although, I do wish they'd added more narrative depth... hint hint).<br><br>In the end, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is a game that'll leave you feeling all sorts of emotions – from excitement to nostalgia to just plain old confusement. It's not perfect, but it's got heart, and that's what counts.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a queer narrative with a cool futuristic setting, then NEURODIVER might just be the ticket. Just remember to temper those expectations, folks – this game's got its own special brand of weirdness.",
