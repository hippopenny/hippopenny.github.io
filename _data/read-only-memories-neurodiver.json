The premise is ripe for exploration â€“ a futuristic world where memories can be manipulated like code? Sign me up! And I'm not alone; the critics are having a blast (literally) with this one.<br><br>God is a Geek gave it a 95, saying it's \"a wonderful sci-fi romp\" with a story that will leave you breathless. Noisy Pixel agrees, calling it \"top-notch\" and praising its \"fun, upbeat story.\" Even Shacknews, who had some beef with the game (more on that later), still manages to have a blast with Neurodiver.<br><br>But not everyone is convinced. Slant Magazine gives it a 60, saying the game's premise opens doors to creative possibilities it doesn't quite live up to. And Checkpoint Gaming takes things down a notch, giving it a 65 and calling it \"underwhelming\" due to its lack of freedom and simplistic puzzle design.<br><br>Now, I'm no critic (although I do have a great title), but it seems like Neurodiver is getting mixed signals. Maybe I'll just play the game myself and see if I can find some middle ground...<br><br>What do you think, fellow gamers? Have any thoughts on Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER? Let's get the conversation started!",
