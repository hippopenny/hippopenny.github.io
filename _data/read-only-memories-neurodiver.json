With its unique blend of cyberpunk, ancient PC technology, and western anime fandom, it's a true niche gem.<br><br>Let's start with what Slant Magazine had to say - \"It's premise opens the door to an immense, far-reaching embarrassment of creative options that the game is largely either unwilling or unequipped to tap into.\" Ouch, harsh words! But, I mean, who doesn't love a little bit of self-deprecation? Maybe they're just trying to get our attention.<br><br>Moving on to God is a Geek's glowing review - \"Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is a wonderful sci-fi romp with a story that has to be experienced to be believed.\" Yep, this game's got some serious story magic happening. I mean, who wouldn't want to explore the world of ancient PC technology and cyberpunk?<br><br>But wait, what about RPG Fan's review? They say \"Few games have left me feeling as uncertain as Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER has.\" Uncertainty is a great thing in gaming, right? It means there are surprises waiting around every corner. And hey, at least they liked the game!<br><br>Next up, Noisy Pixel chimes in with their thoughts - \"There is a lot to love in Neurodiver... But it's hard not to feel a little disappointed; I think that's partly a problem with my own heightened expectations...\" Yeah, we've all been there. When we're so excited for a game and then it doesn't quite live up to our dreams.<br><br>Shacknews agrees - \"Despite the snags I've mentioned, I'm still thinking about Read Only Memories: Neurodiver well after I finished the story.\" Ah, now that's what I call a successful gaming experience! You want us to remember your game long after we finish it. <br><br>Finally, Gamers Heroes wraps things up with their review - \"Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER provides a fantastic futuristic experience... While we would have appreciated more runway with its brief tale...\" Yeah, who wouldn't want a longer story? But hey, at least the game's got some great visuals and lovable characters.<br><br>Last but not least, Checkpoint Gaming gives us their two cents - \"Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER has a lot to like for fans of 2064: Read Only Memories... But falls far short of the scope and impact of its predecessor.\" Ouch, harsh words again! It seems like this reviewer was really looking forward to something more.<br><br>In conclusion, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is one wild ride. With its unique blend of cyberpunk and ancient PC technology, it's a game that's hard not to love. Sure, there might be some snags here and there, but hey, who doesn't love a little bit of uncertainty in their gaming experience?",
