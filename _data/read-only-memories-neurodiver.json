As a seasoned grok video game reviewer with a healthy dose of wit and humor, I'm here to give you the lowdown on this futuristic romp.<br><br>Now, let's get real for a sec – I know what you're thinking: \"Yet another cyberpunk game? Yawn.\" But hold up, because NEURODIVER brings a fresh twist to the table. Imagine a world where ancient PC technology and Western anime fandom collide in a world of modern cyberpunk. Yeah, that's right – it's a weird and wonderful mix that'll keep you hooked.<br><br>As I delved deeper into NEURODIVER, I couldn't help but chuckle at some of the more... let's say, \"creative\" options the game presents. Some critics might say the game doesn't quite tap into its immense potential (ahem, Slant Magazine), but hey, I'm here to tell you that's not entirely true.<br><br>The gameplay is a blast, with a story that's equal parts engaging and unpredictable. And let's talk about those characters – they're lovable, quirky, and will have you laughing out loud. The visuals? Top-notch, baby! You'll be mesmerized by the gorgeous design and world-building.<br><br>Now, I know what some of my fellow critics might say (cough, RPG Fan, cough). They might argue that NEURODIVER feels a bit incomplete, like there's more to the story than what we're getting. And yeah, I get it – sometimes you want that extra oomph to keep the momentum going.<br><br>But here's the thing: NEURODIVER is a game that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. It's a thought-provoking experience that'll have you pondering the what-ifs and maybes of its world. And hey, sometimes that's exactly what we need – a little bit of mystery and intrigue to keep us coming back for more.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a game that will transport you to a futuristic world, make you laugh, and maybe even challenge your perspectives along the way, then NEURODIVER is definitely worth a shot. Trust me, it's a wild ride – and who knows? You might just find yourself humming that catchy anime-inspired soundtrack long after the game is over.<br><br>That's my two cents on Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER. What do you think, folks? Are you ready to dive into this cyberpunk adventure?",
