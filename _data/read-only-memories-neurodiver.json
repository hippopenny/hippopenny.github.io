But before we jump in, let me just say that I'm excited to see what all the fuss is about – and, of course, poke fun at some critics along the way (wink-wink).<br><br>According to Slant Magazine, NEURODIVER has an \"immense\" creative potential that it's either unwilling or unequipped to tap into. Um, yeah... I get it. It's like when you're playing a game and you're all excited to try new things, but then you realize the game is just not designed for experimentation (or maybe that's just me, trying to justify my gaming habits). Anyhoo, I'm here to see if NEURODIVER lives up to its promise.<br><br>Now, God is a Geek thinks it's a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\" with a story you gotta experience to believe. That's some high praise right there! So, what makes this game so special? For one, the premise is just begging for creativity – imagine exploring the intersection of 20th-century technology and modern cyberpunk (yeah, it's a mouthful). And from what I've seen, NEURODIVER delivers on that front.<br><br>But not everyone is singing the same tune. RPG Fan feels like something was missing after finishing the game multiple times. Maybe they were looking for more content or a certain level of depth? Who knows! All I know is that I'm excited to dig in and see what all the fuss is about.<br><br>Gamers Heroes loves it, saying it provides \"a fantastic futuristic experience\" – and I gotta agree! The world is so immersive, it's like you're right there with ES88 on his hunt for the Golden Butterfly. Now, if only the story was a bit longer... A little more runway wouldn't hurt, you know?<br><br>Lastly, Checkpoint Gaming thinks NEURODIVER falls short of its predecessor, Read Only Memories (which I haven't played, but hey, that's okay!). They love the design and world, but feel it lacks freedom and has simplistic puzzle design. Yeah, those are some major downers.<br><br>Okay, so what did I think? Well, let me just say that NEURODIVER is a wild ride – sometimes in the best way possible (and sometimes not). It's got its ups and downs, like any game. But hey, being a seasonal grok video game reviewer, I'm here to tell you that it's worth checking out!",
