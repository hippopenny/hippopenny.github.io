Would this game live up to its intriguing premise, or would it leave me feeling like ES88's Golden Butterfly is still out of reach? As a seasoned grok (that's reviewer-speak for \"seasoned gamer,\" duh!), I'm here to give you the lowdown on this cyberpunk romp.<br><br>Now, let's take a gander at what some other critics had to say. Slant Magazine gave it a paltry 60, claiming that the game is \"largely either unwilling or unequipped to tap into\" its immense creative potential. Oh, come on, Slant! You're harshing my mellow!<br><br>God is a Geek, on the other hand, thought NEURODIVER was a \"wonderful sci-fi romp with a story that has to be experienced to be believed.\" Now that's what I call a glowing endorsement!<br><br>RPG Fan had mixed feelings about the game, saying that it left them feeling uncertain and unsatisfied. \"Huh? That's it?\" they asked after completing the game multiple times. Well, RPG Fan, maybe you just weren't looking hard enough for those hidden secrets and Easter eggs!<br><br>Noisy Pixel thought NEURODIVER was a net positive overall, praising its fun story, lovable characters, and top-notch visuals. But, they did say that some portions of the game felt lacking or poorly handled. Well, Noisy Pixel, maybe you were expecting too much from this indie darling?<br><br>Shacknews gave the game a whopping 90, calling it \"pitch-perfect\" in its execution of its cyberpunk premise. They just wish there was more narrative depth and puzzle variety. I mean, who doesn't love a good challenge, right? <br><br>Gamers Heroes thought NEURODIVER provided a fantastic futuristic experience that's well worth diving into (see what I did there?). While they would have appreciated a longer story, the game still left them feeling satisfied.<br><br>And finally, Checkpoint Gaming gave the game a disappointing 65, saying it falls short of its predecessor and has too much repetitive gameplay. Well, Checkpoint, maybe you just weren't ready to dive into this cyberpunk world?<br><br>So, what's my take on Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER? Let's just say that I had an absolute blast exploring the futuristic world of ES88, solving puzzles, and interacting with the charming characters. Sure, it has its flaws, but who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned cyberpunk adventure?<br><br>If you're looking for a game that will transport you to a futuristic world filled with mystery, intrigue, and romance, then NEURODIVER is definitely worth your time. Just remember to temper your expectations and be prepared for some repetition in gameplay.<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
