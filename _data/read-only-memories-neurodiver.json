Today, we're diving into the futuristic world of Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER, a cyberpunk adventure that promises to deliver a wild ride. But does it live up to its premise? Let's find out!<br><br>First off, I want to give props to our fellow critics for their takes on this game. Slant Magazine gave it a 60, saying it was \"unwilling or unequipped\" to tap into its creative options (ouch!). God is a Geek, on the other hand, showered it with praise, calling it a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\" with a story that's \"got to be experienced to be believed\" (sign me up for that!). And then there are those who fell in between – like RPG Fan, who found it lacking in development and satisfaction, or Noisy Pixel, who felt a little let down by the game's poor handling of certain aspects.<br><br>Me? I'm just a grog reviewer trying to make sense of this crazy world. So, here's my take: Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is like that one friend you're really excited to hang out with, but then they forget their wallet and can't even buy you a drink. Yeah, it's got some great stuff going for it – the visuals are top-notch, the characters are lovable, and the story has some fantastic moments. But sometimes it feels like the game is just winging it, unsure of what to do with its creative possibilities (Slant Magazine, I see you! . And don't even get me started on those puzzles – a little more guidance wouldn't kill anyone!<br><br>In all seriousness, though, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER does have some real potential. Its world is rich in detail, its characters are quirky and fun, and the story has some great twists and turns. It's just... sometimes it feels like the game gets a little too caught up in its own coolness to really deliver on that promise.<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, if you're a fan of 20XX: Read Only Memories (I know, weird reference), or just looking for a fun, futuristic romp, then NEURODIVER might be the game for you. Just don't expect it to change your life – unless you're really into retro-futurism, in which case it's basically a dream come true.<br><br>That's it for today, folks! Hippo Penny out – see you next time!",
