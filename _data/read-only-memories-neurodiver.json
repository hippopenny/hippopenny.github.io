The premise seemed cool - a futuristic world with cyberpunk vibes and ancient PC tech mixed in? Sounds like a wild ride! But, honestly, I was worried it'd be too niche or confusing for me (yes, I know that's the opposite of what I'm supposed to say as a grok reviewer).<br><br>BUT, oh man, NEURODIVER surprised me! It's not perfect, but it's got some serious charm. The world is visually stunning - those retro-futuristic aesthetics are on point! And the characters? Adorable! ES88 and their squad of misfits had me laughing and rooting for them.<br><br>Now, about those critics... I mean, Slant Magazine, I get what you're saying. You feel like NEURODIVER doesn't quite tap into its creative potential. Same with Checkpoint Gaming - the lack of freedom and simplistic puzzles can be frustrating. RPG Fan's \"Huh? That's it?\" reaction after finishing the game is relatable, too.<br><br>On the other hand, Shacknews' praise for Neurodiver's execution on its premise is spot-on! And Gamers Heroes is right; that brief tale may be a tad short, but it's a blast to explore. Noisy Pixel's mixed feelings make sense - they love the characters and visuals but feel some aspects fell flat.<br><br>GAMINGbible nails it with their \"memorable\" experience comment. I agree; my time with NEURODIVER was... memorable (see what I did there?). The soundtrack? Absolutely top-notch! (Okay, I'm biased towards funky electronic tunes).<br><br>Anyway, if you're on the fence about Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER, don't be afraid to take a chance. It's not perfect, but it's got heart and some seriously cool ideas. Hippo Penny gives it... um, let's just say it gets four out of five grok points!",
