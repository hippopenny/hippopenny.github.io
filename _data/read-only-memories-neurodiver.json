But before we dive into the review, let me just say that I'm not exactly the most objective critic out there. I mean, have you seen my review of \"That One Indie Game That You've Never Heard Of\"? Yeah, it's a real masterpiece (not really). But hey, at least I'm consistent, right?<br><br>Now, onto NEURODIVER! This game is like that one cousin who shows up to the family reunion looking all futuristic and hip. At first, you're all like, \"Hey, what's with the weird haircuts?\" But then you realize they've got a sick beat and are actually really fun to hang out with. That's NEURODIVER in a nutshell - it's all about exploring this crazy cyberpunk world, solving puzzles, and making friends with some of the most lovable characters you'll ever meet.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Let's see what the other critics have to say:<br><br>* Slant Magazine says it's \"largely either unwilling or unequipped to tap into\" its vast creative potential. Yeah, because that's exactly what I want from a game - a reminder of all the things it could've done better.<br>* God is a Geek gives it a 95, saying it's a \"wonderful sci-fi romp with a story that has to be experienced to be believed.\" Um, thanks for the vote of confidence, guys. Now I feel pressure to make my review just as glowing!<br>* RPG Fan thinks it's \"good, but... unsatisfying.\" Yeah, because what's the point of having a cool futuristic setting and lovable characters if the story doesn't go anywhere?<br><br>Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the gameplay! NEURODIVER is all about exploration and puzzle-solving. It's like being a detective in a cyberpunk world (minus the detective part). The visuals are top-notch, and the music is catchy as heck. But don't worry if you're not exactly a sci-fi expert - it's easy to get into, even for us non-tech-savvy types.<br><br>All in all, NEURODIVER is like that one friend who shows up to the party late but brings an amazing playlist and a bunch of fun memories with them. It's not perfect, but hey, at least it's trying! So if you're looking for a game that's got heart, humor, and some seriously cool futuristic vibes, then NEURODIVER is definitely worth checking out.<br><br>Oh, and don't even get me started on the other reviewers who said it was \"underwhelming\" or \"disappointing.\" Like, what even is wrong with you people?",
