Well, some people are talking... others are just scratching their heads.<br><br>Let's start with Slant Magazine, who gave it a 60 and said that the premise opens up an \"immense, far-reaching embarrassment of creative options\" - which sounds like a recipe for disaster if you ask me. I mean, who wouldn't want to play a game that's full of awkwardly-phrased sentences? (Just kidding, Slant Magazine, you're not that bad... most of the time.)<br><br>On the other hand, God is a Geek thinks NEURODIVER is a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\" with a story that's \"got to be experienced to be believed.\" Which, you know, sounds like a glowing endorsement. Although, I have to wonder what kind of crazy sci-fi shenanigans they're talking about... Did someone say something about ancient PC technology and western anime fandom? (Sign me up for that.)<br><br>RPG Fan is more reserved in their assessment, giving it a 78 and saying that the game left them feeling \"unsatisfied\" despite liking it. I can totally relate to that feeling - you know, when you're just so invested in a story that you want more, but the credits start rolling and you're like, \"Huh? That's it?\"<br><br>Noisy Pixel has similar complaints, saying that while they had fun with NEURODIVER, it feels lacking in certain areas. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned video game mystery, am I right?<br><br>Shacknews, on the other hand, is all about praising NEURODIVER's pitch-perfect execution of its premise - even if it's not without its flaws. They say that it's \"a dope slice of niche gaming\" and I couldn't agree more.<br><br>Gamers Heroes chimes in with a glowing 85, saying that NEURODIVER provides a \"fantastic futuristic experience\" despite its brief tale. And finally, Checkpoint Gaming gives it a lowly 65, saying that while it has promise, it falls short of its predecessor (20xx: Read Only Memories).<br><br>So, what's my take on all this? Well, I'll just say that NEURODIVER is a wild ride full of quirky characters and futuristic fun. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something new and different.<br><br>That's it for today, folks! Hippo Penny signing off - see you in the next review!",
