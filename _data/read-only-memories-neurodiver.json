Now, let's get this groovy party started!<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm a sucker for games that blend genres like cyberpunk and sci-fi with RPG elements. And NEURODIVER delivers on that front! The game's premise is all about exploring the intersection of ancient PC technology and modern cyberpunk, which sounds weird, but trust me, it's a wild ride.<br><br>Now, let's get to some specific points. I've got to give credit where credit is due â€“ the game's visuals are top-notch, with vibrant colors and neat character designs. The story's also pretty engaging, especially if you're a fan of 20XX: Read Only Memories (I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds cool). ES88's hunt for the Golden Butterfly is all sorts of captivating!<br><br>However, I do have some beefs with this game. Some critics (ahem, Slant Magazine) might say it doesn't tap into its full creative potential. Now, I won't go as far as saying it's a complete embarrassment of options, but... yeah, maybe a bit. It's like they opened the door to an immense world and then just decided to stop at the first corner.<br><br>Gamers Heroes and Shacknews are spot on when they say this game is all about that pitch-perfect execution. Yeah, some people might be left feeling unsatisfied (RPG Fan, I'm looking at you!), but for me, it's a blast! The gameplay concept is strong, even if it can feel a bit lacking in certain areas.<br><br>But hey, what's a little disappointment when the overall experience is this funky? Neurodiver stands out as a dope slice of niche gaming, and that's something to be proud of. So go ahead, grab your virtual Golden Butterfly, and get ready for some groovy adventures!<br><br>Stay radical, gamers!",
