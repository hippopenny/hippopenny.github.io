I'm back at it again, ready to dive into the world of Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER and give you the lowdown on what makes this game tick (or not).<br><br>First off, let's get the elephant out of the room - or should I say, the Golden Butterfly? Yes, folks, this is a game that's all about chasing down that elusive butterfly, but don't worry, it's more than just a pretty face. The gameplay is where things get really interesting.<br><br>Imagine being a grok (that's me!) who gets to explore a futuristic world filled with retro vibes, anime charm, and sci-fi goodness. You'll hack, you'll puzzle-solve, and you'll make some tough choices that'll shape the story in meaningful ways. It's like being Neo in the Matrix, minus the whole \"being a super-cool action hero\" thing (although, let's be real, I do have my moments).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about those other critics? Well, let me tell you, they're all talking about something different. Slant Magazine says it's a creative embarrassment, God is a Geek calls it a sci-fi romp, and RPG Fan is just plain confused (don't worry, friend, we've all been there). But the real question is - does any of this matter?<br><br>To me, NEURODIVER is less about the scores or the snarky comments and more about the experience. It's like a fine wine - you gotta let it breathe, appreciate its unique quirks, and enjoy the ride.<br><br>And speaking of rides, I'll be taking mine to explore the world of NEURODIVER. See you there!",
