It's your favorite seasonal grok video game reviewer here, and I'm back with a review that's gonna make you go haywire!<br><br>I'm diving into the world of Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER, a game that's got everyone talking. Well, except for Slant Magazine, who seems to be stuck in neutral. More on that later.<br><br>First off, let's talk about the premise. I mean, who wouldn't want to explore the intersection of ancient PC technology and western anime fandom? It's like a love child between Tron and Cowboy Bebop! The world-building is top-notch, folks. You'll be hooked from the get-go.<br><br>Now, about those puzzles... I've got some good news and bad news. The bad news is that they can be a bit wonky at times. But the good news is that they're not so challenging that you'll want to pull your hair out (like Noisy Pixel did). It's a perfect balance of fun and frustration.<br><br>The characters, oh boy! They're as quirky as I am after a few too many energy drinks. You'll fall in love with ES88's hunt for the Golden Butterfly, and the soundtrack is pure magic. It's like someone poured a bottle of fairy dust into your ears!<br><br>Now, let's take a look at what our friends from the critics' circle have to say:<br><br>Slant Magazine thinks it's an \"immense, far-reaching embarrassment\" (ouch). RPG Fan felt unsatisfied after completing the game multiple times (bless their heart).<br><br>Noisy Pixel was left feeling a little disappointed due to poor handling of some areas. That's okay, Noisy – we all have our off days!<br><br>Shacknews loves it so much they want to spend more time in this world. Gamers Heroes agrees, saying it provides a fantastic futuristic experience.<br><br>GAMINGbible had issues with the puzzles and story length, but overall enjoyed their time with NEURODIVER.<br><br>And Checkpoint Gaming... well, they were underwhelmed (sorry, guys!).<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I think you'll find that Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is a wild ride filled with charm, wit, and plenty of futuristic fun. Just don't expect it to change your life – unless you're as easily impressed as I am.<br><br>That's Hippo Penny outta here! See you in the next review, folks!",
