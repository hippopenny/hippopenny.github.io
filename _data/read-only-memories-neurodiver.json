Like a grok video game reviewer?) critic, I'm always excited to share my thoughts with you, dear reader.<br><br>First off, let's get to the nitty-gritty. NEURODIVER is a sci-fi romp that takes place in a futuristic world where memories are currency. Sounds like a wild ride, right? Well, it mostly is! The game's premise opens up all sorts of creative possibilities (more on that later), and the story has to be experienced to be believed. But more on that in a minute.<br><br>Now, let's take a gander at what the other critics are saying. Slant Magazine gave it a 60, citing that the game is \"largely either unwilling or unequipped to tap into\" its vast creative potential. Ouch! That sounds like a whole lotta underwhelmed-ness going on.<br><br>On the flip side, God is a Geek loved it with a score of 95, calling it a \"wonderful sci-fi romp\" that's full of charm and character. You can't get much higher praise than that, folks!<br><br>RPG Fan gave it a solid 78, but ended up feeling unsatisfied after completing the game multiple times. They liked the characters, but felt like something was missing. Hmm, I wonder what that could be...<br><br>Noisy Pixel came in at 70, saying there's plenty to love about NEURODIVER, from its fun story and lovable characters to the strong gameplay concept and top-notch visuals. However, they did feel a little let down by certain aspects of the game. Better than 60, that's for sure!<br><br>Shacknews gave it a score of 90, saying that despite some snags, NEURODIVER is still an awesome experience. They praised its pitch-perfect execution and world-building, but wished there was more narrative depth and puzzle complexity.<br><br>Gamers Heroes chimed in with an 85, calling it a \"fantastic futuristic experience\" that's worth diving into.<br><br>Lastly, Checkpoint Gaming gave it a 65, saying that while NEURODIVER has a lot to like for fans of the original Read Only Memories, it falls short of its predecessor. The lack of freedom, simplistic puzzles, and unsatisfying conclusion left them feeling underwhelmed.<br><br>And now, dear reader, it's my turn! Hippo Penny here has got some thoughts to share...<br><br>So, what did I think? Well, let me tell you - NEURODIVER is a wild ride that will keep you hooked from start to finish. The premise is indeed vast and full of creative possibilities, but sometimes I felt like the game didn't quite live up to its potential. The story's got some great moments, and the characters are super lovable... but there's just something missing.<br><br>I mean, don't get me wrong - it's still a great game! But maybe that's because I've been spoiled by so many amazing indie games in recent years. Either way, if you're looking for a fun, futuristic romp with some quirky charm and characters, then NEURODIVER is definitely worth checking out.<br><br>And there you have it, folks - my take on Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER! What do you think? Have any thoughts to share? Let's get this grok-tastic conversation started in the comments below!",
