I'm excited to share my thoughts on this game, and who knows, maybe the internet gods will smile upon me and grant me a higher Google ranking (wink-wink).<br><br>First off, I want to give you a glimpse into what I think of this game. In a nutshell (or a pixelated sphere, if you will), Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is an engaging ride that's part detective mystery, part futuristic adventure, and all-around fun. It's got style, it's got substance, but, as with most things in life, it's not without its quirks.<br><br>Now, let's take a look at what the critics had to say. Slant Magazine thinks the game is \"lacking\" creative options, which is... interesting, considering the premise is all about exploring and discovering new things! Ah, the critics can be tough sometimes (wink). RPG Fan says it left them feeling uncertain and unsatisfied – I guess that's what happens when you have high expectations (like I do with pizza toppings)! Noisy Pixel thinks there are some \"lacking\" areas, but overall, they enjoyed their time with NEURODIVER. And Shacknews? Well, they just love it! Gamers Heroes says it's a fantastic futuristic experience, and GAMIINGbible has some minor complaints, but overall, it was still enjoyable.<br><br>I'll be honest – I had my share of mixed feelings while playing this game. The characters are lovable, the setting is rad, and the premise is intriguing. But sometimes, the puzzles feel too simplistic or the story doesn't quite come together (like when you're trying to remember a password and it's just... *sigh*). Still, NEURODIVER has that certain je ne sais quoi that keeps you coming back for more.<br><br>In conclusion, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is an entertaining ride that will keep you hooked. It might not be perfect (what game is?), but it's definitely worth exploring and discovering the world of ES88. So, if you're looking for a fun, cyberpunk adventure with lovable characters and a rad soundtrack, then NEURODIVER is the way to go!",
