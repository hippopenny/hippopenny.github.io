But before we begin, I just want to say that I'm no expert critic like those fancy-pants folks from Slant Magazine or God is a Geek. Heck, I'm not even sure what my score would be if I had to give one - probably something embarrassingly low, given how hard I am on myself (see: this entire review).<br><br>Now that we've got the self-deprecation out of the way, let's get down to business! NEURODIVER is an absolute blast to play. The story is a wild ride, full of twists and turns that'll keep you guessing until the very end. I mean, where else can you find a game that combines ancient PC technology with modern cyberpunk and western anime fandom? It's like a mashup of all my favorite things (hello, nostalgia!).<br><br>The visuals are top-notch, and the characters are lovable - even if they do feel a bit underdeveloped at times. But hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned sci-fi mystery to unravel? The gameplay concept is strong, with puzzles that'll keep you engaged without feeling too challenging or frustrating.<br><br>Of course, not everyone's going to agree with me (looking at you, Noisy Pixel). Some folks might feel like the game falls short in terms of freedom or narrative depth. And hey, I get it - there are definitely moments where NEURODIVER feels a bit lacking.<br><br>But for me, the magic lies in its ability to balance these differing elements and create an experience that's greater than the sum of its parts. It's like a fine-tuned machine, folks! (Okay, maybe not that fine-tuned, but you get the idea).<br><br>So what do I think? Well, I'm no critic extraordinaire (see: my score), but I'll give you this - NEURODIVER is an absolute hoot. It's a game that'll keep you entertained for hours on end, with just enough substance to make it worthwhile.<br><br>And if you don't believe me? Just ask Shacknews - they're still thinking about it (awww). Or heck, go read the review from Gamers Heroes and see what kind of futuristic fun you can have!",
