From the snazzy visuals to the lovable characters, this game has captured the hearts of many a critic... but is it all sunshine and rainbows? Let's take a peek at what the pros have to say.<br><br>Slant Magazine gave it a score of 60, saying the game opens up a ton of creative possibilities, but ultimately fails to tap into them. Yeah, no kidding - we've all been there, right?<br><br>RPG Fan had a more mixed bag, scoring it an 78 and stating that while the characters are cool, their development kinda stalls. They completed the game multiple times and still felt unsatisfied - now that's a conundrum!<br><br>Noisy Pixel chipped in with a score of 70, saying they loved the story, characters, and visuals... but were left feeling a little disappointed. Hey, we've all had those moments where our expectations get the better of us, right?<br><br>Shacknews went all-in on Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER, giving it an impressive score of 90. They praised the game's world-building, characters, and execution, saying it's a \"dope slice of niche gaming.\" Yeah, we can get behind that!<br><br>Gamers Heroes also gave it a high score of 85, stating that while it could've had more runway for its story, the experience is still worth diving into. We're all about those brief but fabulous tales, aren't we?<br><br>Checkpoint Gaming, however, was a bit more downbeat, giving it a score of 65. They felt the game lacked freedom and had simplistic puzzle design, which ultimately made their experience feel underwhelming.<br><br>Lastly, GAMINGbible scored it a 70, saying they had some issues with the puzzles and story, but the characters, setting, and soundtrack made up for it. We're all about that soundtrack life, am I right?<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, I think we can all agree that Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER has its highs and lows - but who doesn't, right? It's a game that's got some amazing elements, like its world-building and characters, but also stumbles in other areas.<br><br>As for me, Hippo Penny, I'm gonna say this game is a wild ride full of twists and turns. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth your time - especially if you're a fan of cyberpunk and adventure games. And hey, who knows? You might just find yourself having a blast exploring the world and solving puzzles.<br><br>That's all for now, folks! Stay groovy, and until next time...",
