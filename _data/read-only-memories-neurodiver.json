This sci-fi romp has got everyone talking, from Slant Magazine's 60 out of 100 (ouch!) to God is a Geek's glowing 95 out of 100! But what does it all mean? Can this game live up to its creative premise?<br><br>As I dived into the world of NEURODIVER, I found myself drawn into an immersive futuristic experience. The characters are quirky and lovable (RPG Fan agrees!), and the story is a wild ride. Gamers Heroes thinks so too, giving it an 85 out of 100!<br><br>Now, let's get to those naysayers! Slant Magazine thought NEURODIVER was a bit of a disappointment, while Checkpoint Gaming called it \"underwhelming\" and \"disappointing\". But what did Noisy Pixel think? Well, they gave it a solid 70 out of 100, praising the visuals and gameplay concept!<br><br>And then there's Shacknews, who thinks NEURODIVER is so close to being an all-timer! If only it had a bit more narrative depth and some puzzle guardrails... Hmm, sounds like someone might be a bit harsh on the game!<br><br>So, what did I think? Well, let's just say that NEURODIVER has got me hooked! I loved exploring the world, chatting with the characters, and solving those puzzles. Sure, it's not perfect - we've all got our criticisms (hello, Slant Magazine!) - but overall, I'm having a blast!<br><br>And that's Hippo Penny's two cents on Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER! What do you think? Have you played the game? Share your thoughts in the comments below!",
