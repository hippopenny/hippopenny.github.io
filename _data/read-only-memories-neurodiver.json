As I embark on this journey, I'll be keeping a watchful eye out for those pesky critics and their snazzy scores.<br><br>First off, let's get one thing straight: this game is all about vibes. It's got that laid-back, cyberpunk-cool factor going on, like a neon-lit anime dream come to life. And you know what? I'm here for it! The game's premise is pure gold, folks – ES88's quest to find the Golden Butterfly is basically an excuse to explore this crazy- cool world and meet some seriously awesome characters.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the gameplay?\" Ah, my friend, that's where things get a little hairy. See, the puzzles are... let's say, \"challenging.\" I mean, they're not necessarily bad, but they're definitely not going to win any awards for originality or difficulty. And don't even get me started on the story – it's like they took all the excitement and tension from a typical sci-fi adventure and replaced it with... nothing.<br><br>BUT, here's the thing: despite its flaws, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is still an absolute blast to play. The characters are so charming, you'll want to hang out with them forever (or at least until they're done with their storylines). And that soundtrack? Absolutely top-notch! It's like the game's own personal DJ, spinning tracks that perfectly capture its funky cyberpunk spirit.<br><br>Now, I know some of those critics I mentioned earlier might say otherwise – like Slant Magazine, who thought the game was \"largely unwilling or unequipped to tap into\" its creative potential. Or Checkpoint Gaming, who found it lacking in freedom and complexity. But hey, what do they know? They're just a bunch of stuffy old critics trying to ruin everyone's fun.<br><br>In all seriousness, though, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is definitely an acquired taste – but if you're into quirky, offbeat games with heart, then this one might be right up your alley. So grab some popcorn (or whatever your snack of choice is), sit back, and get ready to dive into this wonderfully weird world!",
