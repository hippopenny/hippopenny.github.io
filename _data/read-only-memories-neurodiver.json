After all, who can resist a good dose of cyberpunk flair?<br><br>Now, let's take a peek at what other critics have to say about NEURODIVER. *scans reviews* Oh boy, it looks like some folks are feeling a bit... uncertain about this game? Slant Magazine gives it a 60, saying that the premise is just begging for creativity to shine through, but unfortunately, the game doesn't quite deliver. Meanwhile, God is a Geek is absolutely smitten with NEURODIVER, calling it \"a wonderful sci-fi romp\" with a story that's \"got to be experienced to be believed.\" *nods* Yeah, I can see why they'd say that. The visuals are indeed stunning.<br><br>But what about the rest of you? Do you agree with Shacknews that this game is \"pitch-perfect execution on its premise,\" or do you side with Checkpoint Gaming, who thinks it falls short of its predecessor's impact and scope? *chuckles* Well, I'm here to give you my two cents - and by two cents, I mean a whole lot more than that, because this review is going to be LONG. *winks*<br><br>So, what did I think of NEURODIVER? Well, let me tell you - the gameplay was a blast! The way ES88 navigates through memories and alters the narrative is pure magic. I loved how the game rewards exploration and encourages you to dig deep into the story's secrets. The characters are all unique and lovable in their own ways, from the enigmatic scientist to the quirky detective.<br><br>Of course, not everything is sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes, the puzzles feel a bit too simplistic or obtuse (hello, Noisy Pixel!), and there were moments where I felt like I was stuck in a loop (RPG Fan, anyone?). But overall, NEURODIVER has got it going on!<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that'll transport you to a futuristic world of cyberpunk wonder, with lovable characters and brain-teasing puzzles, then Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is the perfect fit! *picks up controller again* Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some more gaming to do... or maybe just re-experience that wonderful story for the umpteenth time.",
