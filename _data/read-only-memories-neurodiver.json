And trust me, folks, NEURODIVER is one heck of an adventure! But before we dive in, let's take a look at what the other critics are saying... *winks*<br><br>Apparently, Slant Magazine thought it was \"an immense, far-reaching embarrassment of creative options\" that the game was either unwilling or unequipped to tap into. Ouch! That's like me trying to solve a rubix cube blindfolded while getting hit with a water balloon (just an analogy, folks). But hey, being an underdog never hurt anyone (except maybe my mom, but that's a whole different story).<br><br>On the other hand, God is a Geek thought it was \"a wonderful sci-fi romp\" with a story that needs to be experienced to be believed. I'm inclined to agree! The game has this infectious enthusiasm that makes you want to jump in and join the party (which, let's be real, is what we're all about here at Hippo Penny HQ).<br><br>Now, where was I? Ah yes, RPG Fan thought it was... well, uncertain. Like me when trying to decide between pizza and tacos for lunch (decisions, decisions!). The characters are cool, but their development stops before the storylines gain any traction. I get that; sometimes we need a little more meat on those bones.<br><br>Noisy Pixel felt a little let down, expecting more from this futuristic romp. But hey, even with some disappointment, there's still a lot to love! The gameplay concept is strong, and those visuals? Top-notch, baby!<br><br>Shacknews thought it was \"a pitch-perfect execution\" of its premise, mixing cyberpunk and anime fandom. I'm sold! Who wouldn't want to spend hours exploring this world with its lovable characters?<br><br>Gamers Heroes loved the futuristic experience (and who can blame them?) while Checkpoint Gaming found it lacking in freedom and depth, leaving us with an underwhelming conclusion.<br><br>Okay, okay, enough about what everyone else thought. Let's get back to NEURODIVER! So, what do I think? *pulls out confetti*<br><br>In a nutshell (or should I say, in a futuristic, cyberpunk-themed piñata?), Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is an absolute blast! The world-building, characters, and storytelling all come together to create this immersive experience that's hard not to enjoy. Of course, there are some areas for improvement – what game doesn't have those? – but overall, it's a fantastic ride.<br><br>And now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the puzzles?\" Ah, my friends, I'm happy to report that they're... well, let's just say, not the most challenging. *winks* Think of them as an excuse to explore this wacky world and have some fun with its quirky characters.<br><br>In conclusion (or should I say, in a futuristic, cyberpunk-themed finale?), Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is an absolute must-play for fans of sci-fi adventures and anyone looking for a unique gaming experience. Trust me, folks – it's worth the ride!<br><br>Time to wrap up this review (literally – I have some confetti left over). Thanks for joining me on this groovy journey through NEURODIVER! If you're ready to dive in and explore this futuristic world, then Hippo Penny says... GO FORTH AND GROK!",
