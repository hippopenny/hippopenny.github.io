You know, it was good while it lasted, but now it's gone, and all you're left with are some weird, fragmented memories.<br><br>I mean, who doesn't love a good cyberpunk romp? I'm not that guy (anymore). But, hey, this game does have its moments. Like when ES88 meets the cool cat, Babel. Or when you're solving puzzles and... actually, those parts are kinda meh. But more on that later.<br><br>Let's get to the critics, shall we? Slant Magazine gave it a paltry 60, saying the game didn't quite live up to its creative potential. Yeah, no kidding – I mean, have you seen some of the weird stuff people do in this world? It's like they took all the leftover anime ideas from the 80s and mashed them together.<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, God is a Geek gave it a glowing 95, calling it \"a wonderful sci-fi romp.\" I mean, I guess if you're into that sorta thing. Me? I'm more of a... well, not so much.<br><br>RPG Fan gave it a solid 78, but still felt unsatisfied. Like when you finish a game and realize there's no sequel in sight – or worse, there isn't even a DLC. <br><br>Noisy Pixel chimed in with a 70, saying the visuals are top-notch, but some parts feel lacking. Yeah, like that one level where you have to navigate through a crowded market and suddenly it's just... nothing.<br><br>Shacknews gave it an impressive 90, praising its world-building and characters. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend hours exploring this futuristic cyberpunk city?<br><br>Gamers Heroes concurred with a score of 85, saying the game provides \"a fantastic futuristic experience.\" Yeah, if you're into that sorta thing.<br><br>And then there's Checkpoint Gaming, which gave it a dismal 65, calling it underwhelming and disappointing. Ouch! I guess they were expecting more... like actual gameplay or something.<br><br>All in all, Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is like that one friend you have – it has its good moments, but sometimes it's just... there. And hey, if you're into that sorta thing, then go for it!",
