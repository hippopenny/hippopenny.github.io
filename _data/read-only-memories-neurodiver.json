Well, let me tell you, I'm not one to shy away from poking fun at myself or others (yes, that includes the esteemed Slant Magazine). So, without further ado, here's my take on NEURODIVER.<br><br>Now that we've got the introductions out of the way, let's get down to business. NEURODIVER is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve - literally, if you count the protagonist ES88's futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic. And I mean it as a compliment when I say it's like slipping into a pair of worn jeans: comfortable, familiar, and ready for some old-fashioned gaming fun.<br><br>The world-building is top-notch; you'll find yourself immersed in a retro-futuristic landscape that feels like the lovechild of 80s neon-lit sci-fi and Japanese anime. And don't even get me started on those characters - ES88's crew of misfit hackers, cyberpunk vigilantes, and quirky tech-whizzes are straight-up lovable.<br><br>But what really sets NEURODIVER apart is its narrative. Now, I won't lie - it can feel a tad fragmented at times, with plot threads getting pulled in different directions. But hey, that's part of the fun! You'll find yourself piecing together clues, decoding ancient mysteries, and making tough choices that will leave you wondering what could've been.<br><br>Of course, not every critic agrees. I mean, Slant Magazine seems to think NEURODIVER is just a missed opportunity (ouch, burn!), while Shacknews praises its pitch-perfect premise and world-building. And hey, who am I to argue? Maybe they're right - maybe NEURODIVER is just too... weird for some people.<br><br>But hey, that's what makes it so special! It's like a cyberpunk fever dream come true: messy, fragmented, and full of wonderful surprises. And if you can stomach the occasional head-scratcher or two, then buckle up - because this game is going to take you on a wild ride!<br><br>And there you have it, folks! Hippo Penny out.",
