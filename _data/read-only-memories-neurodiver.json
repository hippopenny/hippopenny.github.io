I'm not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical at first (okay, fine - more than a bit). But hey, that's what makes this review so darn special - it's like me trying to make sense of all these fancy-pants critics and their scores!<br><br>Slant Magazine says it's got potential, but the game is \"largely either unwilling or unequipped to tap into\" its creative options. Hmm... sounds like someone didn't quite get the memo on how to have fun with this game! <br><br>God is a Geek gives it a glowing 95, calling it a \"wonderful sci-fi romp.\" Yeah, that's what I'm talking about - a romp! Although, let me clarify: they mean a romp like going through a weird, futuristic theme park, not actual roller-coaster-riding fun. <br><br>RPG Fan is all, \"I liked it, but...\". You see, they thought the characters were cool (YAY!), but the storylines didn't quite take off. And I'm like, \"Huh? That's it?\" Yeah, I get it, though - sometimes you just need more content to flesh out the experience.<br><br>Noisy Pixel is all about balance - they loved the game, but had some issues with certain parts feeling lacking and poorly handled. Like when I try to do a tricky puzzle, only to realize I accidentally broke something... Ah, the struggles of being a gamer!<br><br>Shacknews thinks Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER is \"a dope slice of niche gaming.\" And honestly, that's exactly what it is - a fun little romp through some amazing worlds. Just don't expect too much from the story, and you'll be golden!<br><br>Gamers Heroes says it provides an \"amazing futuristic experience.\" Yaaas, I agree! It's like someone took all my favorite sci-fi shows and mashed 'em together with some super-fun video game action.<br><br>Checkpoint Gaming is all, \"Falls short...\" Yeah, I get it - it didn't quite live up to the hype. The world might be gorgeous, but if the gameplay is lacking, what's left?<br><br>So there you have it! Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER - a wild ride through futuristic worlds with some amazing characters (but maybe not that much story). Trust me, folks, this game is a real treat for anyone who loves exploring new places and meeting quirky characters. And hey, if all else fails, just pretend you're having a super-fun romp through an anime show!",
