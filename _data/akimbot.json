    "comment": "**Hippo Penny - A Grok at Akimbot: Where Ratchet Meets a Bot**<br><br>Ah, the nostalgia! As I dive into the world of Akimbot, I'm immediately hit with waves of familiarity. This game is like looking into the mirror, where every reflection is a loving homage to the PS2 era's finest action-platformers - and by that, I mean Ratchet & Clank, specifically. The developers seem to have said, \"You know what? We're just gonna go all in on this Ratchet thing.\" And honestly, who can blame them?<br><br>**Not Your Grandma's Akimbot**<br><br>Now, I'm not one of those critics who screams, \"Originality! We need more originality!\" because let's face facts - some games are meant to be a love letter to another game. And if it means revisiting the golden days of PS2 gaming with some modern flair (a.k.a. making me smile and reminding me why I fell in love with these types of games in the first place), then sign me up!<br><br>**A Few Minor Gripes**<br><br>While Akimbot gets a lot right, there are moments where it falls short. Sidekick Shipset is a bit of an overstay - but hey, that's just a suggestion for some trimming down their role to make them more lovable and less obnoxious. We're in favor of a love-hate relationship when done well, though!<br><br>The unbalanced side tasks can get frustrating at times, much like other games that want to throw us into the depths of action without letting up (you know who I'm looking at, Jak & Daxter era!). Checkpoints, as always, are a contentious issue within the gaming world - and not everyone will come out on top here.<br><br>**The Wrap-Up**<br><br>In conclusion, Akimbot is more than just a clone of Ratchet & Clank. It's an acceptance - not only by critics but also players, that sometimes it's okay to follow what made us enjoy games back in the PS2 days with their own twist and creativity. Don't get me started on how charming it is; it's refreshing to see something this light-hearted, especially when we're all around praising modern titles for various reasons.<br><br>To all those who loved Ratchet & Clank and are now in charge of developing the next best thing (we won't know till later), take a cue from Akimbot: make it fun, be bold, give us side missions that excite us (even if frustrating at times), have some lovable characters, and don't forget the originality to keep players on their toes.<br><br>Keep up the groking and play well!",
