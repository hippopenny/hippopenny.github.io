The critics are in agreement: Gestalt has some serious charm. RPG Site thought it was \"an extremely enjoyable experience\" despite some nitpicks. COGconnected agrees that the combat and progression are top-notch (even if those dodgy dodge-rolls got on their nerves). Metro GameCentral is all about that 16-bit style, praising the game's polished graphics and deep combat. Even Shacknews enjoyed their time with Gestalt, despite a few quibbles about storytelling. <br><br>But, of course, not everyone was entirely won over. TheSixthAxis thinks the world is charming but the story falls flat. GameOver.gr gives it a resounding thumbs-down, calling the platforming basic and the combat dated. And Slant Magazine? Well, they just think Gestalt gets lost in its own Metroidvania-ness.<br><br>So what's the takeaway here? If you're a fan of action-platformers or Metroidvanias (or both!), there's definitely enough to love about Gestalt: Steam & Cinder. The game has some serious heart and soul put into it, even if it stumbles a bit here and there. And hey, who doesn't love a good 16-bit aesthetic? <br><br>So go ahead, give Gestalt a spin. You might just find yourself humming the tune of that catchy little soundtrack (it's got some serious bite, by the way). Hippo Penny - approved!",
