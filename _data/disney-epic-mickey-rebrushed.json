Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is like the grumpy uncle at Thanksgiving dinner - you might not always know what to expect, but that old-school charm can't be denied.<br><br>First off, let's get one thing straight: these critics don't mess around! They're all giving this game high praise, some more than others, of course. PSX Brasil is gushing over the story, WellPlayed is having a field day with the art and simplicity, God is a Geek (okay, maybe not that geeky) just wants to platform up Space Mountain and restore that It's a Small World ride... Who can blame 'em?<br><br>GamersRD, Gamer Escape, and TheGamer all seem to agree that this Rebrushed edition has done its job in updating the controls, graphics, and whatnot. Even GAMINGbible is singing Disney's praises (Space Mountain, anyone?). Heck, I'm not even mad at the score inflation - these critters are having a waltz with nostalgia!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Seasonal Grok, this is starting to sound like a hippo rave!\" And... you're right! I mean, there's no denying that Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed has its... special charm. Like when Uncle Scrooge decides to surprise everyone with a pi√±ata-filled tree house party. Sure, we might not always agree on what makes for good gaming (Hey, hey, hey! Stop looking at me like that!), but in the spirit of re-re-remakes, here's my take: Rebrushed is a delightful blast from the past, just waiting to get its paws on your platforming skills!<br><br>Time to wrap things up with Hippo Penny: \"Hippo-Rific Review Score (Self-Declared): 8.3/10 - That's 'cause it's like sharing a bag of chips among friends!\"",
