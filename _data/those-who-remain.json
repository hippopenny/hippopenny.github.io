    "comment": "Those Who Remain falls short of its potential, with fussy controls, lackluster stealth, and a narrative that fails to shine. However, it offers an eerie atmosphere, inventive puzzles, and moments of genuine tension in its shape-shifting world. While the game has its flaws, it still manages to create an intriguing and intelligent story that may appeal to horror enthusiasts. Despite its shortcomings, Those Who Remain is worth exploring for its unique elements and atmospheric experience.",
