    "comment": "Dead Island 2 is a gruesomely entertaining zombie-slaying experience that delivers on the promise of what the series is all about. With just enough narrative and social satire, it provides ridiculously entertaining action and mayhem, making it the most creative, scary fun with a shooter in quite some time. Despite some technical issues and flaws, it's a highly entertaining cavalcade of carnage that will leave players highly satisfied.",
