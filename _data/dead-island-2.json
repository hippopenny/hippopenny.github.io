Dambuster Studios takes the undead mayhem to the next level with gory and outrageously entertaining action. Sure, it may not be the deepest game narrative-wise, but who needs deep storytelling when you can have this much fun turning zombies into bloody confetti? With loads of weapons, anatomically correct zombies, and a substantial run time, Dead Island 2 delivers a gruesomely satisfying experience that will have you addicted to zombie slaughter for hours. Just make sure to watch out for a few technical glitches along the way.",
