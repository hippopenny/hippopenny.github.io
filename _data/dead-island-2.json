    "comment": "In Dead Island 2, Dambuster Studios delivers a gory and entertaining zombie-slaying experience that is ridiculously fun. The game revives the zombie apocalypse sandbox with its mayhem and ample content, despite some technical issues. With just enough narrative and social satire, it manages to keep the player engaged for a substantial run time. It may not be the deepest swimming pool in Bel Air, but it certainly offers a creatively scary and fun shooter experience.",
