    "comment": "Dead Island 2 delivers a blood-soaked, zombie-slaying extravaganza that's both ridiculously entertaining and highly satisfying. With its substantial run time and mayhem-filled gameplay, this sequel improves upon the original and injects much-needed fun back into the zombie apocalypse sandbox. Though it may not be the deepest swimming pool in Bel Air, it certainly makes for a creatively scary shooter experience that will keep you gleefully hacking and slashing for days on end.",
