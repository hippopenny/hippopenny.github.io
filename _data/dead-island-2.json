With its mix of gory action, social satire, and substantial gameplay, it's a killer adventure that will keep you hacking and slashing for hours on end. While it may stumble here and there with technical issues, the sheer fun and mayhem it brings to the table make it a must-play for fans of the zombie apocalypse sandbox genre.",
