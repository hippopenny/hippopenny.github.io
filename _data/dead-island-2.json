    "comment": "Grab your sunscreen and baseball bat, because Dead Island 2 is a hilariously gory romp through the zombie-infested California coast. Dambuster Studios delivers an over-the-top zombie slaying experience that's absurdly entertaining. The game's narrative and social satire provide a twisted backdrop to the relentless action, making it a blood-soaked blast to play. Sure, it has a few technical hiccups, but when you're bashing in zombie skulls with a custom-made weapon, who cares about a glitch or two? Dead Island 2 brings fresh mayhem to the undead apocalypse genre, and it's a bloody good time.",
