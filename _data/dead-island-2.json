    "comment": "Dead Island 2 is a gory and ridiculously entertaining zombie slaying experience that delivers on the promise of the series. With just enough narrative and social satire, it provides substantial fun despite some technical issues. Dambuster Studios has created a highly entertaining cavalcade of carnage that takes joy in smashing, splatting, and slicing the undead into meaty chunks. While it may not be the deepest swimming pool in Bel Air, playing it was the most creative, scary fun with a shooter in quite some time.",
