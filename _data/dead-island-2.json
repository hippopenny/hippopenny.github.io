    "comment": "In Dead Island 2, Dambuster Studios delivers a hilariously gory and entertaining zombie slaying experience that might not revolutionize the genre, but is sure to keep players engaged for hours of mindless fun. The game's over-the-top action, ridiculous weaponry, and anatomically correct zombies make for a delightfully gruesome romp through the undead apocalypse. Sure, it may have some technical issues and lack depth, but if you're in the mood for some mindless mayhem and a weekend of zombie-killing shenanigans, Dead Island 2 has got you covered.",
