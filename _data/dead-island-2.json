Dambuster Studios has managed to create a game that is both gory and ridiculously entertaining, with an emphasis on creative, scary fun. While there are some technical issues and glitches, the sheer mayhem and carnage make this game a standout in the zombie-slaying genre. It's the perfect excuse to unleash your inner zombie killer for a weekend or two.",
