Let me tell you, I'm not just a seasonal grok video game reviewer; I'm also a bit of a groovy enthusiast, which is why I'm excited to dive into the Monster Hunter Stories Collection. Now, before we get started, let's talk about those other critics and their fancy scores. You know, like Gaming Age with its 90 out of 100 (whatever that means). Or Vandal with its 80 - I mean, who doesn't love a good Vandal score? It's like they're trying to sabotage my own review with all that critical acclaim!<br><br>But enough about them; let's get back to the game! Monster Hunter Stories is an action-RPG that's perfect for young players (like me, I'm feeling young today!). The combat system is thrilling, and you'll be hooked on collecting new monsters like they're Pok√©mon (which, let's be real, they kinda are). It's a fun spin on the traditional Monster Hunter series, and even if it shows its age in some areas, it's still an awesome experience.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the sequel?\" Ah, don't worry; we'll get to that. For now, let's just enjoy this collection of two great JRPGs on modern consoles (PC, PS4, Switch - yep, all the bases are covered!). The visual improvements are a nice touch, and you'll have plenty of hours to sink into these games.<br><br>I do wish there was more to offer beyond the visuals, but hey, that's just me being greedy. At the end of the day, we've got two beautiful Monster Hunter games here that more people can finally enjoy playing (see what I did there?).<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny says: \"Monster Hunter Stories Collection is a groovy way to spend your afternoon. It may not be perfect, but it's a fun ride with plenty of action and adventure to go around. So, grab some popcorn, sit back, and get ready to hunt those monsters like a pro (or at least, a groovy enthusiast)!\"",
