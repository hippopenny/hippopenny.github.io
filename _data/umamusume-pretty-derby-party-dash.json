I've got some... um, let's call them \"expert\" opinions from the critics gang over here.<br><br>According to INVEN, the game is like a party in your pants (but not too much because, well, you know). It's fun for fans and all, but maybe gets boring after a while. Yeah, who doesn't love a good horse-girl-bonanza, though?<br><br>GameGrin thinks it's an upbeat title with some quirky fun, which I agree with ( Party Dash vibes!). And Shacknews (who I'm sure has played every party game ever) says it's likeable but not mind-blowing. Shakes head.<br><br>TheSixthAxis loves the retro art direction and how it captures the energy of being a horse girl fan... while simultaneously pointing out some technical issues? What a wonderful friend!<br><br>God is a Geek says it's decent, yet somehow manages to spoil the experience with poor events and lack of tutorials? Um... what happened here?<br><br>Lastly, Noisy Pixel wishes there were more content but thinks what we've got has quality (just not enough horse-girl-frenzies to go around).<br><br>Tech-Gaming is like that one friend who's all \"meh\"... sorry. Four contests are bland and get stale after a few replays.<br><br>That's it! Pretty Party Dash feels... party-able?",
