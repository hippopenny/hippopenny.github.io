I mean, who wouldn't want to be part of this cosmic celebration? With near-perfect scores across all major gaming critics, it's safe to say that Astro Bot is not only the best platformer of 2024 but also a shining example of greatness in game design.<br><br>Let's take a look at what some of our esteemed colleagues (yes, I'm poking fun at you guys) have said about this intergalactic phenomenon:<br><br>From **Hey Poor Player**, we learn that Astro Bot is \"a product of passion, playfulness, and perfectly portioned platforming pastimes\" - basically, a loving hug in game form. Give me all the nostalgia feels!<br><br>**GAMINGbible**, on the other hand, calls it \"true perfection.\" And who can deny that? With \"every sense elevated,\" Astro Bot has firmly cemented its place as an icon of the platforming genre. Heartwarming trip down memory lane guaranteed!<br><br>But what about those who ventured into the unknown (aka, me)? **GameSpew** simply declares: \"To play Astro Bot is to love Astro Bot.\" Alrighty then, let's do just that! It's a flawed experience... no, scratch that - perfection in every sense of the word.<br><br>Even critics who were slightly less enamored with the game still managed to sing its praises. **Wccftech**, for instance, calls it \"a platformer for all skill levels,\" touting the unique features of the PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller. You get what you pay for!<br><br>On the same page is **GamingBolt**, which thinks Astro Bot is a wonderful love letter to PlayStation fans everywhere - along with being an exceptional platformer, naturally! (Of course!) And from **Hardcore Gamer**, we learn that team ASOBI really knows how to \"crack the code\" of delivering fun and engaging experiences.<br><br>But don't worry; even slightly lower-scoring critics like **GamersRD** still manage to squeeze in some glowing praise: Astro Bot is an experience full of surprises, challenges, and immersion that only possible with DualSense.<br><br>All joking aside, one thing's certain - each critic seems to find something unique to love about this beautifully crafted platformer. Even if there aren't necessarily reasons for us all to differ, it becomes clear that, at its core, Astro Bot aims high in its design... while landing just-as-impressive shots on nostalgia and style!<br><br>Whether or not we agree wholeheartedly with scores (which ultimately mean less), one reality stands firm: this time around, it truly feels like gamers have landed something special.",
