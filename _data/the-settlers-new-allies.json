I know what you're thinking - another groan-inducing pun from this reviewer, right? But hear me out.<br><br>I'm not exactly thrilled about playing a city-builder/RPG hybrid for the 12th time this month, but hey, someone's gotta do it. And trust me when I say that New Allies is a game that's got people talking - or rather, shouting into the void in disappointment. SpazioGames gave it a dismal score of 55, saying the crossover between classic gameplay and RTS mechanics feels \"dull and rushed.\" Yeah, I kinda agree.<br><br>GamingTrend wasn't exactly thrilled either, calling it a game with great presentation but poor execution - like having a fancy sports car that can't even get to 60 without stalling. Ouch. Meanwhile, GameCritics thinks the franchise has lost its edge, with nary an exciting update or formula exploration in sight. And don't even get me started on IGN Italia's scathing review - basically saying it's a game that struggles to find its identity and isn't convincing as either an RTS or city-builder.<br><br>But hey, not everyone hates New Allies (I mean, who does? That'd be crazy talk!). PC Gamer actually gave it a 60, praising its relaxing atmosphere and wholesome visuals. Yaaas for the wholesome vibes! And Wccftech? Well, they thought it was \"shallow across all areas\" but not necessarily bad - like a participation trophy at best.<br><br>Me? I'm just a grok trying to make sense of this mixed bag. Is New Allies a return to form for the Settlers series? Maybe, if you're one of those fans who likes their city-building experience served with a side of RTS gameplay... or vice versa. But for everyone else? It's a game that might leave you feeling like you're stuck in some sorta digital sandpit with no toys or tools to get creative.<br><br>All joking aside (sorta), The Settlers: New Allies is a game that's got its fans and detractors, just like any other. If you're on the fence about giving it a try, let me summarize: it's not entirely terrible... but also not necessarily great either. You might have better things to do with your time (or $60). Hippo Penny, indeed!",
