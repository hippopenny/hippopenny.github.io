Welcome to my groovy review of The Settlers: New Allies, where I'll be diving into the world of city-building and war-waging without getting too bogged down in the negativity (mostly) from other critics.<br><br>As I played through this game, I couldn't help but feel like I was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The classic gameplay of The Settlers series seems to have been mashed together with real-time strategy elements, resulting in a game that feels... well, let's just say it's not exactly the most thrilling experience.<br><br>Some critics might say this game is a slow-paced and overly simplistic take on city building and war waging. I mean, what even is the fun in building a city if you're not gonna have to worry about pesky things like resource management or defense from those pesky barbarians?<br><br>But hey, at least the wholesome looks and relaxing atmosphere are on point! That's what I'm saying when I read that PC Gamer guy's review. \"Wholesome\" is exactly the vibe I got while playing this game. It's like having a nice cup of tea with your favorite grandma, minus the awkward small talk.<br><br>Now, where some critics went wrong (in my humble opinion) is in expecting The Settlers: New Allies to be something it's not. IGN Italia said it tries to reinvent the series, but I think that's just giving it too much credit. It's like trying to put a square peg into... well, you get it.<br><br>And don't even get me started on GameStar's \"New Alliances demolishes everything the series has previously built.\" Um, what? That sounds like some harsh criticism right there! I mean, sure, the game might not be perfect, but it's not all bad either. Wccftech said it's shallow across all areas and held together by an average narrative - yikes!<br><br>But hey, at the end of the day (or should I say, the Settlers' franchise?), what matters is how you feel while playing this game. And for me, that was... well, let's just say I didn't exactly get the warm fuzzies.<br><br>So if you're a die-hard Settlers fan or just looking for something to pass the time while you're sipping that cup of tea with your grandma, The Settlers: New Allies might be worth checking out. But don't go in expecting too much - it's not going to win any awards for originality.<br><br>And hey, at least it's not as bad as those SpazioGames folks said! Hippo Penny out!",
