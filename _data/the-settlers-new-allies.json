Or so I thought, until I read what some critics had to say. Spoiler alert: it's not all sunshine and rainbows.<br><br>Let's start with SpazioGames, who gave it 55 out of 100. They called it \"dull and rushed,\" stating that the game fails to breathe new life into the franchise. Ouch! That stings. Maybe they just expected too much from this Settlers game?<br><br>Next up is GamingTrend, who slapped a 40 on their review. They complained about poor execution and lacking content, comparing it to being in a sandbox with no toys or tools. Yeah, that sounds pretty frustrating.<br><br>GameCritics joined the chorus of negativity, awarding it a paltry 10 points out of 100. They argued that there were no exciting updates or formula explorations, and even the buggy quality was salt in the wound. Yikes! Sounds like this game needed some serious TLC.<br><br>Now, PC Gamer gave it a slightly more positive review, scoring it 60. They found it slow-paced and simplistic but enjoyed its wholesome looks and relaxing atmosphere. Ah, someone liked it!<br><br>IGN Italia agreed with GameCritics, saying that New Allies struggled to find its identity as either an RTS or city-builder. That's like trying to decide between pizza and tacos â€“ you can't go wrong either way! <br><br>GameStar, on the other hand, absolutely trashed the game, giving it a 55 (oh, the irony!). They claimed it demolished everything the series had built before. Wow, that's harsh!<br><br>Last but not least, Wccftech chimed in with a 50 out of 100. They thought the game was shallow across all areas, with basic city-building and strategy elements held together by an average narrative. Meh.<br><br>So, where does this leave me? Well, I'm excited to dive into The Settlers: New Allies and see what's what for myself. Will it be a hit or miss? Only time will tell!<br><br>Stay tuned for my review, and let the games begin!",
