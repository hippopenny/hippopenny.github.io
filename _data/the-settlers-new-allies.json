    "comment": "Hippo Penny - The Settlers: New Allies is the latest installment in the beloved franchise that has been around for ages, and boy, does it need some fresh blood! But let me get this straight - the critics are saying it's not great, but I'm here to give you the lowdown on what really matters: the gameplay!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about all those scathing reviews from SpazioGames, GamingTrend, and GameCritics? Well, let me tell you, I'm not here to sugarcoat things. The game does have some issues, but that's why we play games in the first place, right? To have fun!<br><br>I mean, seriously, what's wrong with a little bit of simplification? PC Gamer said it was \"overly simplistic\" and IGN Italia thought it struggled to find its identity - big deal! I think they just got lost in their own complexity. New Allies is like the cool new friend who makes everyone feel included. It might not be perfect, but hey, at least it's trying!<br><br>And don't even get me started on GameStar saying it \"demolishes everything\" the series has previously built - I mean, what did they expect? A total reboot?! That would be crazy talk! (But honestly, if they wanted that, they should've said so in their review)<br><br>Now, Wccftech says it's \"shallow across all areas\"... okay, sure thing, buddy. Maybe you're just expecting too much from the franchise. Newsflash: sometimes a good game is just... a good game! You don't need to reinvent the wheel or revolutionize gaming (although that would be pretty cool).<br><br>So, here's my two cents - The Settlers: New Allies isn't perfect, but it's not terrible either. It's like that one friend who shows up to your party and tries to fit in, even if they don't always get the joke.<br><br>Play it for yourself and see what you think!",
