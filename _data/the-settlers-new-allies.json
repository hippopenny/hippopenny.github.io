Some are stoked, while others are scratching their heads.<br><br>Let's start with the good stuff. PC Gamer gave it 60 points out of 100, saying it's a \"slow-paced and overly simplistic\" game, but hey, it looks wholesome and has a relaxing atmosphere. I mean, who doesn't love a good city-builder that doesn't require too much effort?<br><br>Meanwhile, SpazioGames was like, \"Uh, this crossover between classic gameplay and RTS mechanics feels dull and rushed.\" Yeah, we get it – you wanted more from The Settlers franchise, and New Allies just didn't deliver.<br><br>GamingTrend was even harsher, calling it a game with great presentation but poor execution. They're not wrong; the $60 price tag is steep when there's so little content to enjoy. It's like being in a sandbox with no toys or tools – what's the point?<br><br>GameCritics went full-on negative, saying The Settlers: New Allies is a game that doesn't boast any positive reasons to warrant a purchase. Ouch! That stings.<br><br>IGN Italia echoed some of these sentiments, saying it struggles to find its identity as an RTS or city-builder. And let's not forget GameStar, which basically trashed the entire game, calling it \"everything the series has previously built\" (demolished, get it?).<br><br>Finally, Wccftech gave it 50 points out of 100, saying it's not a bad game, but not good either. That's like being stuck in neutral – you're not really going anywhere.<br><br>So, what do I think about The Settlers: New Allies? Well, I'll leave the score to your imagination (wink). Let's just say that while some critics are down on this game, others might enjoy it for its laid-back vibe and simple gameplay. If you're a fan of city-builders or RTS games, you might find some charm here.<br><br>But honestly, if you're expecting a return to form for The Settlers franchise, New Allies might not be the best choice. It's more like a nice-to-have addition rather than a must-play. Hippo Penny says: Don't rush into this game expecting too much – it's a gentle stroll, not a wild ride!",
