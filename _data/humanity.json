It's your boy here, back with another groovy review that'll make you wanna get down and puzzle like nobody's business!<br><br>So, let's get this party started with Humanity, the latest brain-twister from Enhance. I'm gonna dive straight into the gameplay, 'cause that's what it's all about, right?<br><br>Humanity is like Lemmings, but instead of cute little critters, you've got an army of tiny humans working together to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. It's a beautifully chaotic mess, with each level presenting a new challenge to outsmart.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Grok, this sounds like your average puzzle game.\" But trust me, folks, Humanity takes it to the next level (pun intended). The gameplay is as addictive as those pesky cat videos on YouTube. You'll find yourself thinking outside the box (or in this case, the level) and experimenting with different solutions.<br><br>The critics are raving about it, too! IGN gave it a 90%, saying it's \"a beautiful, modern reimagining\" of Lemmings. GameSpot chimed in with an 80%, praising its \"constantly-evolving gameplay\" and \"unique premise.\" And let's not forget Game Informer, who scored it an 85% for being \"imaginative\" and having \"excellent clicky electronic beats.\"<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna lie - there are some nits to pick. A hint system would be nice (COGconnected, you're not the only ones thinking this!). And maybe a few levels could be tightened up. But hey, that's just me being a perfectionist.<br><br>In conclusion, Humanity is an absolute blast! It's got heart, it's got humor, and it's got puzzles galore. So grab some popcorn (or a handful of Lemmings), get ready to think outside the box, and join the party!<br><br>That's it for this review, folks! Stay groovy, and remember - in the immortal words of The Who: \"We're all just trying to get by... with a little bit of Humanity!\"",
