It's your boy, back with another review that's so good, it'll make you wanna play video games all day (and night, and morning, and... you get the idea).<br><br>Humanity is the latest game from Enhance, a studio known for their artsy, puzzle-filled goodness. And let me tell you, they've outdone themselves this time around.<br><br>The game's premise is simple: you're a god, guiding little creatures (called \"humans\") through levels to reach their goals. Sounds easy, right? WRONG! These humans are like ants on a mission from God – they need your guidance to survive the increasingly complex puzzles that lie ahead.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Self-deprecating reviewer dude, why should I care about a game that's just about guiding tiny people?\" Well, my friend, it's all about the journey, not the destination (but let's be real, who doesn't love watching those tiny humans reach their goals and explode in confetti?).<br><br>The gameplay is where Humanity truly shines. The puzzles are clever, inventive, and eclectic, just like your average critic would say (cough, cough). Each level presents a new challenge, whether it's redirecting the flow of human traffic or using environmental obstacles to your advantage.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the visuals – minimalist, yet striking. It's like someone took all the best parts of an 8-bit game and blew them up to life size (not literally, because that would be weird). The electronic beats are also top-notch, adding to the overall ambiance of the game.<br><br>Now, I know some of you are thinking, \"But what about the difficulty spike? Didn't the other critics complain about it?\" Ah, yes. Well, let me tell you, friend – when life gives you lemons, make lemonade (or in this case, when life gives you a sudden increase in puzzle complexity, just get creative and find ways to overcome it).<br><br>In conclusion, Humanity is a must-play for fans of the genre (and non-fans, because who doesn't love saving tiny humans from certain doom?). With its clever gameplay, striking visuals, and electronic beats, this game will have you hooked from start to finish.<br><br>So go ahead, give Humanity a try. And remember – it's not just about guiding little people; it's about being part of something bigger than yourself (or at least, that's what I keep telling myself).",
