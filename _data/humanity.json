It's like they took all the best parts of Lemmings and turned them up to 11. Or should I say, 20? Because, let's be real, this game is all about little creatures doing big things.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But wait, isn't this just another puzzle game?\" Ah, no! Humanity is special because it's all about... well, humanity. It's a game that will make you laugh, cry (in a good way), and maybe even get a little emotional. Okay, okay, I know that sounds sappy, but trust me, it's true!<br><br>The critics agree: IGN gave it 90%, GameSpot said it was \"easy to get sucked into for long periods of time\" (um, yes, please!), Game Informer raved about its \"beautiful package\" and clever puzzles, Vandal thought it was a \"fantastic puzzle game\", GamingTrend praised its \"eclectic\" design, COGconnected called it \"weird and wonderful\", and God is a Geek thought it was an \"expertly crafted puzzler\".<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Is Humanity the best thing since sliced bread (or, you know, a barrel of monkeys)? Well, I won't give away my score (wink, wink), but let me just say that this game is a real treat. It's like they took all the best parts of puzzle games and put them in a blender, then hit puree. And what came out was... well, you'll just have to play it for yourself!",
