Let's get this review party started!<br><br>I'm not gonna lie; I'm a bit biased towards games that make me feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself – you know, the whole \"we're all in this together\" vibe. Humanity checks all those boxes and then some! This game is a masterclass in puzzle-making, storytelling, and sheer creative genius.<br><br>Now, let's talk about the critics (or should I say, the critic-izers?). IGN says it's \"a beautiful, modern reimagining of Lemmings that feels as esoteric and artsy as Enhance's previous games.\" Yeah, no kidding! It's like they're trying to make us all feel smart by using big words. GameSpot calls it a \"charming, engaging, and inviting puzzle adventure\" – I mean, who wouldn't want an invitation to a party with puzzles?<br><br>Game Informer praises the game for finding that delicate balance between challenge and satisfaction. I think they might be onto something there... maybe Enhance is trying to tell us something about humanity through this game? Vandal just says it's \"fantastic\" – I guess when you're that busy being fantastic, you don't have time for elaborate sentences.<br><br>GamingTrend goes full-on poetic, saying Humanity is \"vast, clever, inventive, and eclectic.\" Okay, sure thing! It's like they're trying to describe the game as a whole, but ended up describing their own personality instead. COGconnected gives it a shout-out for being \"weird and wonderful\" – I think we can all agree on that!<br><br>And God is a Geek? Well, let's just say they're an expert in... expertly crafted puzzles. Yeah, no kidding! It's like they went to Puzzle School and got a degree in making things fun and challenging.<br><br>In all seriousness, though (just for a sec, I promise!), Humanity is the kind of game that'll keep you entertained for hours on end. It's a beautiful blend of puzzle-solving, storytelling, and creativity – and it's got the perfect balance of challenge and satisfaction. So go ahead, give it a try, and let the games begin!<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go plan my own user-created levels...",
