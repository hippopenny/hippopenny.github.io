As I dive into this review, I'll try not to get too carried away with my own awesomeness (spoiler alert: it's hard not to when you're as fantastic as me).<br><br>Humanity is a game all about solving puzzles and helping little creatures called \"Lemmings\" reach their goals. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, buckle up, because this game will have you clicking your way through increasingly complex levels in no time.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the critics?\" Ah, yes! Those esteemed folks over at IGN gave it a 90, saying it's a beautiful, artsy take on the Lemmings formula. GameSpot chimed in with an 80, praising its engaging gameplay and unique premise. And let's not forget Game Informer, who awarded it an 85 for striking a perfect balance between challenge and creativity.<br><br>As for me? Well, I'm no stranger to puzzle games. In fact, I'm a master of them (it's a well-known fact). But even I was impressed by Humanity's ability to keep me on my toes. The puzzles are cleverly designed, with just the right amount of challenge to keep things interesting.<br><br>Of course, not everything is sunshine and rainbows. A few reviewers noted some minor issues with difficulty spikes or the hint system (which, let's be real, is always a good idea). But overall, Humanity is a top-notch puzzler that's sure to delight fans of the genre.<br><br>So, if you're in the mood for something that will test your mettle and make you feel like a genius (or at least, that's what I keep telling myself), then Humanity is the game for you. Hippo Penny says: go get it!",
