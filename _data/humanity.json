Let's get this review party started!<br><br>I'm not gonna lie, I was super excited to dive into Humanity, a game that's all about solving puzzles and making things go boom (in a good way, of course). And boy, did it deliver! Enhance has outdone themselves with this one.<br><br>Now, let me see what the other critics have to say... Ah, IGN says it's \"a beautiful, modern reimagining\" – I mean, who wouldn't want that? GameSpot calls it \"charming\" and \"inviting\" – yep, got that too! And don't even get me started on Game Informer's \"delicate balance\" between challenge and fun. It's like they're all trying to out-fluff each other (in a good way, again).<br><br>But let's get real, folks. I'm here to give you my two cents – or should I say, my Hippo Penny? Okay, okay, I'll stop with the penny puns.<br><br>In all seriousness, Humanity is an absolute blast! The game's unique premise has you playing as little creatures, solving puzzles, and making decisions that impact the world around them. It's like being a tiny god (minus the whole \"omnipotence\" thing). And let me tell you, it's SO satisfying to watch your creations come to life.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the difficulty? Is it too hard?\" Ah, friend, that's where the magic happens. The puzzles are cleverly designed to get progressively harder, but not so hard that you'll want to pull your hair out (unless you're me, and then you'll just laugh maniacally).<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning some of the weird and wonderful things about Humanity. Like the fact that it's full of adorable little creatures that you get to manipulate – talk about a mood boost! And the soundtrack? Oh boy, it's like a never-ending supply of funky beats!<br><br>All in all, Humanity is a must-play for anyone who loves puzzle games (or just wants to have some fun). Trust me when I say it's an experience that'll make you go \"Ah-ha!\" as you solve each puzzle and watch your world come together.<br><br>And that's Hippo Penny's review of Humanity – what more could you ask for?",
