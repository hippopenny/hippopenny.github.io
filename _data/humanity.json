I'm back with my review of Humanity, a game that's got critics going ape over its clever puzzle-solving and... well, let me get into it.<br><br>First off, kudos to Enhance for making a game that's all about embracing our weirdness. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a god-like figure guiding countless little feet through obstacle courses while solving puzzles? It sounds like a recipe for disaster, but somehow, Humanity pulls it off.<br><br>The gameplay is where the magic happens – or should I say, the pitter-patter of countless little feet? As you control your godly self, you'll need to manage resources, prioritize actions, and make tough decisions that affect the fate of humanity (pun intended). It's a delicate balance between guiding your tiny foot soldiers and avoiding catastrophe.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Self-deprecating reviewer, how do your skills stack up against those of the gaming giants?\" Well, let me tell you – while I might not have scored a 90 or an 85 like some of these fancy critics, I've got a unique perspective to share. And that's what counts, right?<br><br>In all seriousness, Humanity is a game that's easy to get sucked into, with its constantly-evolving gameplay and striking audiovisual landscape. But what really sets it apart is the user-generated content aspect – you can dive into levels crafted by others or try your own hand at creation.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a puzzle adventure that's as charming as GameSpot says or as inventive as GamingTrend claims, Humanity might just be the game for you. Just remember to take it easy on those little feet; they're counting on you!<br><br>That's all for now – until next time when I'll be reviewing another game with my special blend of humor and humility. Hippo Penny, out!",
