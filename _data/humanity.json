Now, I know what you're thinking - why should I care about another review when there are already so many out there? Well, my friend, let me tell you: these other critics might have given Humanity glowing reviews (and deservedly so!), but that's exactly why I'm here to add a dash of humor and a pinch of self-deprecation to the mix.<br><br>As I booted up Humanity for the first time, I was struck by its whimsical visuals and infectious electronic beats. It's like someone took all the best parts of Lemmings, added a splash of artiness, and served it with a side of puzzle-y goodness. Now, I'm no expert (see what I did there?), but even I can appreciate when a game does something new and interesting.<br><br>The critics have already sung its praises, from IGN's ode to \"pitter-patter little feet\" to Game Informer's enthusiastic endorsement of the game's challenges. Heck, even Vandal's review is all about how Humanity \"reminded me of those crazy Dreamcast titles.\" (I'm still waiting for my time machine so I can play those games again, btw.)<br><br>What struck me most, though, was how this game seamlessly blends its puzzles with a thought-provoking narrative. It's like Enhance took a long, hard look at what it means to be human and decided to create a puzzle game that reflects that message. And you know what? It works! The more I played, the more I felt like I was solving not just puzzles but also figuring out humanity itself (pun intended).<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning some minor quibbles. For instance, COGconnected did mention a hint system could've been helpful (I agree!), and God is a Geek noted that the game can get a tad too difficult at times. But honestly, these are just nitpicks when you consider how much fun Humanity is.<br><br>So, what's my take on this delightful puzzle game? Well, let's just say I'm already planning my next gaming session with Humanity - and that's all the encouragement I need to give it a solid thumbs-up (or should I say, paws-up?). If you're looking for a game that will challenge your problem-solving skills while also making you think about the human condition, look no further than Humanity. Trust me, your hippo penny won't be disappointed!",
