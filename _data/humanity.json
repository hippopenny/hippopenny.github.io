And let me tell you, I'm not surprised! This game is a real treat for puzzle lovers like myself.<br><br>At first glance, Humanity looks like just another Lemmings-esque game where you control tiny humans trying to get from point A to point B. But trust me, things get complicated quickly. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter all sorts of obstacles, from environmental hazards to crazy contraptions that require some serious problem-solving skills.<br><br>What I love most about Humanity is its ability to balance challenge and creativity. You see, each level presents you with a unique set of circumstances and objectives, and it's up to you to figure out how to get those little humans across the finish line in one piece. It's like solving a puzzle within a puzzle!<br><br>And let me tell you, I had a blast trying to find the perfect solution for each level. It was like my inner gamer was saying, \"Hey, we can do this! We're humanity, after all!\"<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without some good-natured roasting of other critics. IGN says it's \"esoteric and artsy,\" which I guess is code for \"this game is too smart for me.\" GameSpot calls it a \"charming\" and \"engaging\" puzzle adventure, but I think they just mean it's a great game for people who don't like being challenged too much. Game Informer says it's all about balance between difficulty and creativity, which is basically saying that the game is just right... not too hard, not too easy.<br><br>Vandal says it's \"fantastic\" and reminded them of old-school Dreamcast titles, which is like saying they're a fan of good games. GamingTrend calls it \"vast,\" \"clever,\" and \"eclectic,\" which is like saying it's a game that tries to do too many things at once... but somehow makes it work! COGconnected says it's \"weird\" and \"wonderful,\" which I think means they're trying to say it's a game that's hard to understand, but actually pretty great.<br><br>In conclusion, Humanity is an absolute must-play for anyone who loves puzzle games. It's challenging, creative, and just plain fun. So go ahead, get your hands on this game, and show the world what you're made of!<br><br>Review Date: Right now, because I'm still playing it!",
