But before we get started, let me just say that I'm not exactly the next big thing in gaming journalism. In fact, my skills are so rusty, I'm pretty sure the GameFAQs community is still trying to figure out how to use my old reviews as doorstops.<br><br>Okay, now that we've got our priorities straight, let's talk about Humanity! This game is like a box of chocolates - you never know what kind of puzzle-solving goodness you'll get. And trust me, it's a wild ride from start to finish.<br><br>According to the big shots at IGN (90 out of 100), this game is all about reimagining Lemmings for the modern era. And I'm like, \"Yeah, no kidding! This thing's got more esoteric and artsy vibes than a French art film!\" But hey, that's not a bad thing - it makes for some truly unique puzzle-solving experiences.<br><br>GameSpot (80 out of 100) agrees, saying that Humanity is a charming, engaging, and inviting puzzle adventure that's easy to get sucked into. I'm like, \"Preach! I got so lost in this game, my cat thought I was a ghost!\" And the best part? Once you've finished the main game, there are user-created levels galore to keep you entertained.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about Game Informer (85 out of 100)? Well, let me tell you, they said it's all about striking that delicate balance between challenging puzzles and feeling like a god (heh). And I'm like, \"Yeah, no kidding! This game is so clever, it makes me want to solve all the world's problems!\" Okay, maybe not all of them, but at least some of them.<br><br>Vandal (90 out of 100) also gave this game two thumbs up, saying it reminded them of those crazy Dreamcast titles that Sega used to give us. I'm like, \"Old-school gaming nostalgia alert!\" And GamingTrend (90 out of 100) agrees, praising the game's vastness, cleverness, and inventiveness.<br><br>Last but not least, COGconnected (85 out of 100) chimed in with some words of wisdom, saying that Humanity is weird and wonderful. I'm like, \"Yup! That about sums it up!\" And God is a Geek (85 out of 100) concurred, calling it an expertly crafted puzzler.<br><br>In conclusion, if you haven't already, go grab yourself a copy of Humanity and get ready to have your puzzle-solving mind blown. Trust me, this game's got more twists and turns than a French onion soup recipe. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go practice my rusty reviewing skills - wish me luck!",
