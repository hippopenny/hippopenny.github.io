It's your favorite seasonal grok (that's me!) here to dish out some piping hot review goodness about Enhance's latest puzzler, Humanity!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Self-deprecating humor alert!\" And you're right! I'm all about poking fun at myself and those fancy-pants critics. But don't worry; my wit won't get in the way of this delightful review. So grab some popcorn (or a handful of lemmings, if you will), sit back, and let's dive into the world of Humanity!<br><br>First off, let me just say that these critics are having a blast! IGN gave it a 90%, calling it \"beautiful\" and praising its unique premise. GameSpot also chimed in with an 80%, stating that it's a \"charming\" and \"engaging\" puzzle adventure. And the list goes on!<br><br>Now, about my take on Humanity... In short, I'm having a whale of a time (or should I say, a hippo of a time?). The game's premise is simple yet clever: you're tasked with guiding these adorable, little critters to safety while navigating obstacles and solving puzzles. It's like being the ultimate puzzle-solving hippo!<br><br>Of course, there are some minor complaints here and there. COGconnected noted that the hint system could be improved (I agree; sometimes I needed a gentle nudge in the right direction). But overall, Humanity is a masterpiece! Its unique art style, catchy soundtrack, and challenging yet rewarding puzzles make it a must-play for fans of the genre.<br><br>Now, before I wrap this up, let me just say that I'm loving the competition between these critics. It's like they're having their own puzzle-solving party (or hippo dance-off)! Take IGN vs. GameSpot: both praised the game's beauty and uniqueness, but IGN highlighted its esoteric and artsy elements, while GameSpot emphasized its charm and engagement.<br><br>In conclusion, Humanity is a fantastic puzzler that will keep you on your toes (or should I say, hippo-sized feet?). With its vast array of levels, clever puzzles, and delightful premise, it's an absolute must-play for fans of the genre. And if you don't believe me, just ask those fancy-pants critics!<br><br>That's all for now; stay puzzling, my friends!",
