This time, I'm diving into the world of puzzle-solving with Humanity, a game that's got everyone buzzing like bees at a flower show.<br><br>Let's start with the IGN crew, who gave it a shiny 90%. They praised its \"esoteric and artsy\" vibe, saying it's like Enhance's previous games on steroids. I mean, who doesn't love a good Lemmings-inspired game? It's like being a kid again, but instead of cute little creatures, you get tiny humans running around, trying not to get squished.<br><br>GameSpot chimed in with an 80%, saying it's \"charming\" and \"engaging.\" I agree, Humanity is a real treat. The game's premise is simple: guide your little human friends through obstacles and puzzles to reach the finish line. Sounds easy, right? Wrong! The gameplay evolves constantly, keeping you on your toes like a gamer on a caffeine high.<br><br>Game Informer gave it an 85%, praising its \"delicate balance\" of challenging puzzles and empowering gameplay. I mean, what's not to love about feeling like you're the god of humanity, guiding these tiny humans through treacherous terrain?<br><br>Now, let's talk about the Vandal crew, who also gave it a 90%. They said it reminded them of those crazy Dreamcast titles (RIP, Sega!). And hey, if Enhance can surprise us with its own ideas, that's all the more reason to love this game.<br><br>GamingTrend echoed similar sentiments, calling Humanity \"vast,\" \"clever,\" and \"eclectic.\" I mean, who doesn't love a good puzzle mechanic? It's like being a kid in a candy store, except instead of candy, you get puzzles!<br><br>Last but not least, we have COGconnected, who gave it an 85%. They praised its weirdness and wonder, saying it's \"simple\" yet challenging. And hey, if there's one thing I love about Humanity, it's that it's not afraid to be a little quirky.<br><br>In conclusion, Humanity is a game that's all about being... well, human. It's a puzzle-adventure game that'll keep you on your toes and laughing at the absurdity of it all. So, if you're looking for something new and exciting in the world of gaming, look no further than Humanity. Just don't forget to wear your dancing shoes â€“ you never know when those little humans might start boogieing down!",
