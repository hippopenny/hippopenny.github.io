It's like a big ol' bowl of jollof rice for your gaming soul! But enough about that; let's get to the good stuff - the gameplay!<br><br>Now, I know some critics are saying it's not as revolutionary as others in the genre (hello there, IGN!). And yeah, maybe the platforming and level designs don't exactly reinvent the wheel. BUT, you know what they do have? A double jumping system that makes you feel like a total boss! It's like flying on a hippo-powered hang glider, minus the whole \"flying\" part (obviously). And freezing water? Yes, please!<br><br>But what really gets me is how this game wears its heart on its sleeve. The story is, as Eurogamer puts it, \"vital and passionate.\" It's like the developers took all their emotions, put 'em in a blender, and hit puree! (Just kidding; that would be a weird way to make a game.) Seriously though, this tale of grief and perseverance will have you feeling all the feels.<br><br>Now, I know some critics might say it's not perfect. Game Informer says the gameplay doesn't always match those highs, which is true... but that doesn't mean Zau isn't worth playing! And hey, even SpazioGames acknowledges that it's enjoyable for both casual and hardcore players (just don't expect too much from the replayability department).<br><br>In the end, Tales of Kenzera: Zau is a solid entry in the Metroidvania genre. It might not revolutionize the world, but it'll give you some quality gaming time while making you feel all sorts of emotions.<br><br>Hippo out!",
