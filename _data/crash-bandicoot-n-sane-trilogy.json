Sane Trilogy - a collection of remastered classics that have been brought back from the dead to entertain a new generation.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Hippo Penny, why are you reviewing this game?\" Well, let me tell you. As a seasoned grok (that's critic-speak for someone who's seen it all), I've got some...let's say, \"fresh\" insights to share with you.<br><br>First off, the reviews from other critics are all over the place. Gaming Age is giving it a 100% (yawn), while Steivivor and Areajugones are like two peas in a pod with their glowing 90s and 85s respectively. Meanwhile, Riot Pixels is like the cool kid in school who thinks he's too cool for school - giving it an 80 just because they think they're being all existential about it.<br><br>But let's not forget about your humble narrator (that's me). I'm here to tell you that the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is not exactly a revolutionary game - it's more like a well-preserved museum piece from the PS1 era. However, with some snazzy graphics and sound effects, it's still a whole lot of fun for fans of platformers.<br><br>GameSpot seems to agree, but only in their very own special way. They're like the grumpy old man who complains about how Crash Bandicoot wasn't as innovative or surprising back in its day. Meanwhile, your pal DarkStation (that's me again) thinks the trilogy is a \"reverent and imperfect resurrection\" of an icon - a perfect description for anyone who's been there done that and has the t-shirt.<br><br>And finally, Play LifeStyle gives it some props for being a benchmark for how classic game remakes should be handled. Well said, folks!<br><br>In conclusion (finally!), the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is a fun little retro romp that's sure to bring back memories for those who played it back in the day. And if you're one of those people... well, then you might actually have some hip knowledge about this game.<br><br>So there you have it - Hippo Penny's expert analysis (not).",
