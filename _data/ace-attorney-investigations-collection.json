With the latest installment in the Ace Attorney series landing on the Switch, I'm here to dive into the world of investigations with a critical eye (get it?). <br><br>While the usual suspects have given glowing reviews (see what I did there?), I thought I'd mix things up by trying to not repeat what they said - and instead bring you some fresh insights. So, what's my two cents on Ace Attorney Investigations Collection?<br><br>The revamped visuals are certainly a pleasant surprise! Gone are the pixelated DS graphics (or at least, you can toggle those for a nostalgic feel). Edgeworth, in particular, looks sharp in his new lighting - now I just wish he'd crack open that smile of his. Dick Gumshoe's got an...interesting appearance too, but let's be honest: those comedic timing skills of the detective still shine through.<br><br>One thing I find fascinating is the contrast between cases 1 and 2 - case one has a few pacing issues (*coughs at reviewers \"some pacing\"*, yes?), whereas case two feels more evenly paced (albeit sometimes taking on an identity of its own) and takes advantage of Kay Faraday's fresh perspective.<br><br>Speaking of fresh perspectives, I'm glad these new investigations have given fans hope for future Ace Attorney content - a series that deserves so much love! If you're planning to pick up the Investigations Collection, go ahead and give a shoutout to Capcom; your enthusiasm is sure to be repaid in spades... or should I say, with a collection of delightful mini-episodes? Now if only I could play as Apollo...",
