This game is an absolute delight, and I'm not just saying that because I spent way too many hours playing it. Okay, maybe a little.<br><br>First off, the visuals are straight out of a Studio Ghibli film – you know, the kind where everything looks like a beautifully illustrated book come to life? Yeah, it's that gorgeous! The hand-drawn art is so enchanting that I found myself swooning over every new environment and character design. And can we talk about the Japanese mythology setting for a sec? It's like they took all the most fascinating aspects of folklore and dropped them into a delicious game-baking batter (which, might I add, tastes suspiciously like buttery, crunchy goodness).<br><br>Now, about that gameplay... Well Played (ha! nice one, WellPlayed) said it best: \"It does, after all, feature members of the same team that impressed with their Metroid fan game AM2R...\" Yeah, you can bet your sweet bippy I was hooked from the get-go! The platforming and pathfinding are cleverly designed to encourage exploration and combat – a perfect combo for any self-respecting gamer (or someone who just likes shiny things). Oh, and did I mention the bosses? *chef's kiss* Those are some seriously impressive, challenging fights!<br><br>Now, let's take a peek at what our critic friends have to say:<br><br>* WellPlayed: 95! They praised the game's quality, art style, and clever gameplay.<br>* Game Rant: 90! They said it's \"not a game you can afford to miss\" for fans of metroidvania or platforming.<br>* Hardcore Gamer: 90! They called it \"one truly superb and expertly-crafted metroidvania game.\"<br>* But Why Tho?: 85! They raved about the beautiful art, calling it the most lovely game they've played.<br>* GameGrin: 80! They liked the characters, story, and challenge.<br>* PCGamesN: 70! They thought it played it a bit too safe, but still praised its charm and setting.<br>* Edge Magazine: 60... Okay, so they were a little harsh, but hey, someone's gotta be that critic.<br><br>In conclusion, Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus is an absolute gem! If you haven't tried it yet (or even if you have), grab your controller and get ready to explore this whimsical world. Trust me; you won't regret it!<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
