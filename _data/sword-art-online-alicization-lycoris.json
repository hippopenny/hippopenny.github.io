It's your boy (or girl) Hippo Penny here, and welcome back to the most epic analysis of a game you've probably never played. Today, we're diving headfirst into Sword Art Online: Alicization Lycoris, a JRPG that has left critics and players alike with mixed feelings.<br><br>Now, before I get into the juicy bits, let me set some expectations straight - if you're looking for a perfect score, you won't find it here. Our friend Noisy Pixel gave it an 80, which sounds like a good party grade to me! Shacknews thought it was just okay (70), while LevelUp loved the battle system but got turned off by slow pacing and technical issues (65). The Games Machine couldn't decide either way (60), DualShockers were ambivalent too (56), but PlayStation Universe called it out for being a straight-up broken mess (40). And, oh dear, poor TheGamer basically told you to watch the anime or play anything else instead of this...10.<br><br>What's your take on the game? Join me after the jump as we go back in time to 2020 (or whenever these reviews happened) and try understanding what went wrong (and right).<br><br>**So Many Questions**<br><br>First, do yourself a favor and read LevelUp's review. The battle system sounds fascinating, reminiscent of old-school RPGs. Yet, despite that promise, they couldn't shake off the feeling of boredom while playing through long chapters with no end in sight.<br><br>Meanwhile, Shacknews echoed similar sentiments about pacing problems without adding anything extra to our game play experience. Poorly polished elements such as load times or animations could add frustration beyond normal frustrations felt during gameplay experiences themselves! Meanwhile DualShockers tried their best not be too mean-spirited but had a lack of positive feelings towards this title overall (no bias there whatsoever).",
