    "comment": "Salt and Sacrifice delivers a captivating blend of Monster Hunter mechanics and Metroidvania/Soulslike formula. While its ambitious amalgamation succeeds in offering snappy combat, labyrinthian world exploration, and challenging boss battles, the absence of a map and fast-travel system adds some tedium to its grind. The game demands patience, determination, and a willingness to grind, but ultimately rewards players with a satisfying old-school vibe.",
