    "comment": "Salt and Sacrifice is a rough gem that successfully combines elements from Monster Hunter and the Metroidvania genre into a captivating 2D Souls-like experience. While it falls short in some areas, such as clunky progression systems and frustrating enemy encounters, the challenging combat, level design, and refreshing co-op make it worth a try for fans of the genre. The game's old-school vibe demands patience, determination, and a willingness to grind, offering a new addiction for both original fans and recent Souls converts. With occasional minor frustrations aside, Salt and Sacrifice delivers an enjoyable gameplay experience with deeper choices and more varied mechanics compared to its predecessor. It's an interesting entry in the 2D soulslike niche.",
