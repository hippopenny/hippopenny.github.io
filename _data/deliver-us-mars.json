Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, why should I care about some space game?\" Well, let me tell you - this one's got mystery, intrigue, and some seriously awesome voice acting. But, oh yeah, it also has some major technical issues that'll have you groaning like a space-bound hippo (you get it).<br><br>First off, let's talk about the story. IGN gave Deliver Us Mars 60/100, saying it's a \"rousing mystery\" brought to life by great voice acting and character writing. I agree - the cast is top-notch, and the storytelling is engaging enough to keep you hooked. However, the game's shortcoming lie in its technical performance during cutscenes. You know, those moments where you're trying to get all emotional about some space drama, but instead, you're stuck dealing with glitches? Yeah, that stuff.<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - Worth Playing gave Deliver Us Mars an 84/100, and they're right. The game's got a great balance of exploration, puzzle-solving, and narrative-driven moments. However, they also mentioned the game could use more puzzle ideas to break up the monotony. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned space mystery? But when it feels like the game ran out of steam (pun intended), it can get pretty boring.<br><br>Vandal gave Deliver Us Mars a 70/100, saying it's an \"irregular\" game that tries to do too much. And you know what? They're right - this game is all over the place! But hey, at least it's trying something new, right?<br><br>Hardcore Gamer and GameCritics both gave Deliver Us Mars a low score (50/100). Hardcore Gamer said it feels too long in all the wrong ways (ouch), while GameCritics thought the puzzles were dull and the rock-climbing felt out of place. Ouch is right - these guys didn't mince words!<br><br>Finally, Edge Magazine gave Deliver Us Mars a 70/100, saying it shows that sci-fi action adventures can tell dramatic tales by zeroing in on the minutia (whatever that means). And PC Gamer gave it a 75/100, calling it a \"serious display of sci-fi storytelling talent.\" Yeah, okay - I get it. The game's got its pros and cons.<br><br>So, what does this grok reviewer think? Well, I think Deliver Us Mars is an okay game - it's got some great moments, but it also gets bogged down in technical issues and boring gameplay. If you're a fan of sci-fi space mysteries (like me!), you might enjoy it. But if you're looking for something that'll blow your mind, keep looking.<br><br>That's all for now, folks! Hippo Penny out - see you next time!",
