    "comment": "Hippo Penny, folks! I'm thrilled to be reviewing Deliver Us Mars, a game that's got everyone from IGN to Edge Magazine buzzing. Well, not exactly buzzing... more like scratching their heads and wondering what went wrong.<br><br>As I jumped into this intergalactic mystery-adventure, I was initially stoked by the great voice cast and nuanced character writing. The story of a daughter searching for her wayward father in a Mars colony has real emotional weight to it. But, oh boy, the technical issues reared their ugly heads. Cutscenes stuttered, backstory delivery felt like a chore (thanks, barely-differentiated mannequins!), and don't even get me started on the climbing and platforming mechanics.<br><br>Now, I'm not one to pile on the criticism (okay, maybe I am), but even when the game runs smoothly, those puzzle ideas start feeling stale. It's like Deliver Us Mars bit off more dehydrated astronaut food than it could chew. And yet... there are moments of wonder and satisfaction, especially during exploration.<br><br>Worth Playing agrees that Deliver Us Mars is a compelling ride, with varied gameplay and a great narrative. They do wish for a few more puzzle ideas to spice things up, but overall, they're impressed by the game's balance between story and player agency.<br><br>Meanwhile, Vandal thinks it's an irregular game, probably due to developers trying to bite off more than they can chew (heh, sound familiar?). And don't even get me started on Hardcore Gamer, who felt like Deliver Us Mars was too long in all the wrong ways. Talk about a critical buzzkill!<br><br>GameCritics is another story altogether. They're not exactly enthusiastic about the game's sloppy plot, dull puzzles, or rock-climbing mechanics that feel out of place. And Edge Magazine? Well, they think it's got some great sci-fi storytelling talent, even if the production falls short.<br><br>As for me? I'll leave you to wonder what my score might be... let's just say it's a game that's got its strengths and weaknesses in equal measure. So, will Deliver Us Mars deliver on your expectations? Well, that depends on how much Martian mystery-adventure you're looking for!",
