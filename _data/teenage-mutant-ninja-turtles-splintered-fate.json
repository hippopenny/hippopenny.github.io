I'm back with another groovy review that's sure to make you shell-ebrate!<br><br>This time around, I'm diving into the world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, a roguelike game that promises to be \"tubular\" (yes, I went there). But before we get into it, let me just say that I'm no stranger to reviewing games. After all, I've been around since the dawn of time... or at least since the dawn of Steam.<br><br>Now, back to Splintered Fate! According to CGMagazine, this game is not only a finely crafted roguelike but also one of the best takes on the TMNT franchise in recent memory (90/100). That's some serious praise right there! But what about those other critics? Well, let me tell you:<br><br>Eurogamer Portugal thinks it's a \"funly crafted\" game that captures the spirit and form of the Ninja Turtles (80/100).<br><br>Shacknews gives it a thumbs up for its co-op gameplay and fun vibes (no score, but I'm guessing it's high praise).<br><br>Hobby Consolas loves how simple yet effective the gameplay is on the Nintendo Switch (78/100).<br><br>Vandal notes that while it's not super original, it's still an entertaining title with some great combat and progression systems (75/100).<br><br>TheGamer thinks it's a satisfying roguelite experience that might not reach the same heights as Hades but is still pretty awesome (70/100).<br><br>And last but not least, Digitally Downloaded... well, they're just kind of meh about the whole thing, calling it \"soulless and draining\" and a \"pastiche that's simultaneously decently made but also very bad creative work\" (60/100). Ouch!<br><br>Now that we've got all those opinions out of the way, let's get to my review! In short, Splintered Fate is an awesome game that's perfect for fans of the TMNT franchise. It's got some great co-op gameplay, fun combat mechanics, and a solid roguelike experience. But don't just take my word for it â€“ go play it yourself and see what you think!<br><br>That's all for now, folks! Stay rad, and keep on gaming!",
