This time, I'm talking about Octopath Traveler, where eight characters join forces to travel across the land... and my expectations were high!<br><br>But first, let me give you a quick rundown of what other critics thought. Digitally Downloaded gave it a perfect score, praising its beautiful game design and ambitious storytelling. DarkStation loved how Square Enix \"lovingly\" updated old-school RPG conventions with modern twists. Hobby Consolas and IGN Italia also raved about the presentation and combat system. Even GameSpot was impressed, calling it a re-imagining of a retro aesthetic.<br><br>Now, onto my thoughts! I'm gonna give you the lowdown on why Octopath Traveler is so... hip!<br><br>First off, this game looks like it was plucked straight from a 16-bit era dream sequence. The 2D sprites are so nostalgic and charming that they'll transport you back to the good ol' days of gaming (back when pixels were cool). But don't think this is just a retro throwback – Square Enix put some serious effort into making these characters pop!<br><br>Now, let's talk about those eight wayfaring travelers. Each one has their own story arc, and it's like playing an RPG within an RPG! You get to explore different worlds, battle different foes, and even level up individually (or together). It's a bit overwhelming at times, but hey, that's what makes this game so... trippy!<br><br>Combat, in particular, is where Octopath Traveler shines. Turn-based battles are always a thrill when done right, and Square Enix nails it here. You can chain abilities, use environmental attacks, or even breakdance your way to victory (okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea). It's like an RPG dance party up in here!<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect – Slant Magazine thinks Octopath Traveler plays it too safe. And, yeah, some parts can be a bit predictable or slow-paced. BUT, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned JRPG romp every now and then? It's like a warm hug for your gaming soul!<br><br>In conclusion, Octopath Traveler is all about embracing the old-school while still bringing something new to the table (or in this case, the travel path). If you're looking for a groovy adventure with some of the most charming characters you'll ever meet, look no further! Just don't forget your hip pair of shades and a sense of humor – things can get a little wacky around here!<br><br>That's it for now, folks! Hippo Penny - out!",
