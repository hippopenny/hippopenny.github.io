As a seasonal grok video game reviewer, I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this charmingly old-school meets new JRPG.<br><br>Now, let me start by saying that Octopath Traveler is a real treat for anyone who grew up with 16-bit RPGs. The game's visuals are stunning, with its gorgeous pixel art and beautiful backgrounds. It's like stepping into a time capsule and reliving the golden era of JRPGs.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Let's see what some of our esteemed critics have to say. Ah, yes, IGN gives Octopath Traveler a whopping 93%, calling it \"a JRPG dream come true\" that pays loving tribute to the Super NES era while innovatively moving the formula forward. GameSpot agrees, giving it an 80% and saying it's a game worth playing despite its lesser qualities. Meanwhile, Game Informer praises the game for its retro charm and inventive combat, but notes that it occasionally adheres too closely to antiquated ideas.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the storytelling?\" Well, let me tell you, folks! Octopath Traveler's narrative is a bit of a mixed bag. While it's true that the eight different character stories could've used a little more connection between them, the game still manages to charm and entertain despite this. And hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned JRPG-style storytelling?<br><br>So, what's the verdict? In short, Octopath Traveler is an absolute must-buy for anyone who grew up with 16-bit RPGs or just loves JRPGs in general. With its beautiful visuals, addictive combat, and charming narrative, this game has something for everyone.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny says: \"Octopath Traveler is a real treat for any JRPG fan.\"",
