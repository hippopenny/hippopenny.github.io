Get ready to hop on the Octopath Traveler review train, folks!<br><br>As I dove into this retro-modern JRPG, I couldn't help but think about all those lovely critics who went wild for it. IGN praised its battle system and aesthetic, calling it a \"JRPG dream come true.\" GameSpot thought it was one of the most interesting re-imaginings of a retro aesthetic around. Heck, even SpazioGames got all gushy about seeing old game mechanics meet modern sensibility in a glorious way!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Self-deprecating reviewer alert!\" And you're right! But let me tell you, after playing through Octopath Traveler, I'm still grinning from ear to ear. The battle system is indeed clever, the pixel art is stunningly gorgeous (and not just because it's retro!), and the characters... well, they've got charm oozing out of their... octopus-like heads?<br><br>Now, I know some folks might say, \"But what about the storytelling?\" Well, let me tell you, it's like trying to piece together a puzzle with missing pieces. You get glimpses of character backstories and motivations, but sometimes they feel disconnected. That said, who doesn't love exploring side areas, battling optional bosses, or unlocking those final job classes?<br><br>All joking aside (for now), Octopath Traveler is a game that's hard to put down. Its nostalgic value is undeniable, even for those of us who didn't grow up on the SNES era. It's like finding a vintage gem in your grandma's attic â€“ it might be old-school, but it's still got some serious sparkle.<br><br>So, if you're ready to embark on an octopus-filled adventure with eight unique characters (and maybe a few questionable fashion choices), then Octopath Traveler is the game for you! Hippo Penny gives it... well, let's just say it gets a big ol' thumbs-up from this reviewer!",
