This time, I'm tackling Octopath Traveler, the JRPG that took the world by storm in 2018. But don't worry; I won't make fun of myself too much... yet.<br><br>Now, let's get this over with! What did the \"experts\" say about Octopath? Well, IGN gave it a whopping 93! (Wow, they must have really loved it.) They praised the battle system and aesthetic, saying it was \"a phenomenal homage\" to the SNES era. Yeah, because nothing says \"homage\" like making something look and feel exactly like old-school RPGs.<br><br>GameSpot, not to be outdone, gave it an 80! (Hey, that's still a solid score!) They said it was an \"interesting and effective re-imagining\" of retro aesthetics. Yeah, because we all needed more pixel art in our lives.<br><br>Game Informer chimed in with an 80 as well, saying Octopath felt like a game from an alternate timeline where Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI never went away. (Time-traveling RPGs, anyone?) They praised the retro charm and inventive combat, but also noted it stuck too closely to antiquated ideas at times.<br><br>Nintendo Life gave it a glowing 90! (Okay, this is getting ridiculous.) They called Octopath a \"classic-inspired game\" with a great soundtrack and unique storytelling. This must be what they mean by \"must-buy\" – you won't want to miss it!<br><br>Game Revolution also went with a 90, saying the narrative and character interaction left room for improvement but the overall quality shone through.<br><br>SpazioGames? You guessed it: another 90! They praised the game's old-school mechanics merged with modern sensibility. This must be what JRPG fans dream about – a world stuffed into a cartridge (old-school reference, folks!).<br><br>And finally, GamingTrend gave it an 85, calling Octopath an \"enjoyable, nostalgic romp\" with some nice modern touches. They also noted the game's great music and sidequests.<br><br>So there you have it – the critics' take on Octopath Traveler! (Now, don't get too excited; I'm not going to say my review is better or anything... *wink wink*.) What do you think? Have any favorite JRPGs that might be similar?
