    "comment": "The Finals delivers bombastic fun and thrills with its fresh and exciting take on team-based PVP shooters. Its thrilling destruction, fast-paced gunplay, and unique approach to familiar objectives create a high-octane gameplay experience that feels incredible. While it may have some minor balancing issues and a limited number of maps, the game's potential for growth makes it an absurdly fun shooter that cannot be categorized as just an online shooter. The game captures the essence of living an action film, and its environmental destruction does justice to its game show ambitions. The thrill of navigating the environments and actively engaging in vertical combat provides some of the best multiplayer moments, making The Finals a standout title in a year of groundbreaking video game releases.",
