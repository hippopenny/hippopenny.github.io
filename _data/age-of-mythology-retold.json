I'm back with another review, and this time it's all about the resurgence of... you guessed it - Age of Empires' arch-nemesis, Age of Mythology. **That's right folks, Penny here, back in action!** <br><br>First off, let me say that these critics know their stuff (mostly). Impulsegamer gave it a perfect score (yeah, I'll stop talking once they get used to my wits about them) and thought it was \"a no-brainer\" to re-make this classic. While everyone else agreed on its greatness, the best part? The differences are just minor tweaks - exactly what we love in our games!<br><br>Here's a summary of what Penny loved the most (besides the obvious fanbase that adores this game):<br><br>**Favorite parts:**<br><br>1. **God Powers:** Oh, how nostalgic! Penny enjoyed the aspect that lets your godly units be reused multiple times.<br>2. **Gameplay and Accessibility:** This time around the experience feels fresh while maintaining its familiar roots, making it an enjoyable trip back for those who loved the original (we all did!).<br>3. **Variety in Game Settings:** You'll have to agree with me that age-old campaign maps, modern controls, a well-placed map editor and great cross-play - this game really doesn't feel 20 years old.<br> <br>And so, without further ado... if you were waiting for my seal of approval (it's coming), now it's your turn! Have at the rest! Here are some more scores from \"Penny friendly\" sites that agree with me on everything, because let's face it - this is an excellent game!<br><br>**Your go-to links to check Penny's other awesome game reviews:**<br><br>[link to Game news and scores]<br><br>Stay tuned for yet another great piece of gaming content while Hippo Penny watches you enjoy these beautiful words written in perfect rhyme...",
