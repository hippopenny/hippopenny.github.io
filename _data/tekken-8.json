I mean, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned fight fest? As for me, well... I'm just here for the snacks. But hey, that's what makes life worth living, right?<br><br>Now, let's get down to business! IGN thought Tekken 8 was an \"amazing new entry\" with tweaks to the classic fighting systems and a plethora of offline modes. And, honestly? I can see why! It's like Bandai Namco took all the good parts from previous games and mashed them together with some fresh new stuff. Vandal agrees, saying it's the most fun Tekken to play! Who wouldn't want that?<br><br>SpazioGames just called it \"the best Tekken ever.\" Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking... Hyperbole alert! But let's be real; Tekken 8 is a solid game. COGconnected thought its focus on aggressive gameplay made it the best entry in the franchise (which is saying something, considering the long history of this series). And God is a Geek? Yeah, they liked it too!<br><br>But what about the online mode, you ask? Well, TheSixthAxis says it's vastly improved! Although, Hardcore Gamer might disagree... or not. Their review was so glowing, I'm pretty sure they might've been channeling their inner gaming angel.<br><br>And that's it for this review! Tekken 8: a game that'll keep you coming back for more, whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out. So grab your controller and get ready to rumble!",
