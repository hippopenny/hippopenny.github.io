I mean, who needs another fighting game in their life? But, as it turns out, this baby is the real deal! It's like a fine-tuned machine, with combat that's as smooth as silk and more. So, grab your controller and let's dive into why Tekken 8 is the best thing since sliced bread (or should I say, since sliced combo attacks?).<br><br>First off, let's talk about the critics - yeah, you know, those fancy-pants reviewers who get to play games before anyone else (lucky them!). And boy, do they love Tekken 8! Digital Chumps gives it a perfect score, saying it's \"immersive combat is fluid, cinematic, yet visceral.\" The Games Machine calls it \"another great chapter in a series incapable of making missteps.\" BaziCenter and Twinfinite both give it a 90, praising its fresh take on the series. And Push Square? Forget about it - they're calling Tekken 8 a \"modern fighting game masterclass\"! <br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: what about Game Informer and GamersRD? Yeah, those guys are still stoked about Tekken 8 too! They might not have given it the highest score (83 and 79, respectively), but they both agree that it's a fun arena to test your mettle against friends and rivals.<br><br>So, what makes Tekken 8 so special? For starters, its combat is ridiculously deep - you'll find yourself getting lost in combo strings and air juggles for hours on end. And when you're not busy spamming special moves, the game's story mode is actually pretty entertaining, poking fun at itself with humor.<br><br>But let's be real, folks - it's all about the online modes. Who doesn't love a good old-fashioned King of Iron Fist tournament? It's like being part of something bigger than yourself (or in my case, trying to avoid getting destroyed by actual gamers).<br><br>In conclusion, Tekken 8 is a must-play for anyone who loves fighting games. And if you're new to the series, don't worry - it's super accessible and will have you hooked from the get-go! So go ahead, pre-order it, and join the ranks of the Tekken elite (just don't forget about me, I'll be over here getting my butt kicked online).",
