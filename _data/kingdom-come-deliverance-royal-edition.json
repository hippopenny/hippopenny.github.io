    "comment": "Kingdom Come Deliverance: Royal Edition offers a grueling yet engrossing RPG experience, with its muddy graphics and weak performance somewhat marring an otherwise compelling medieval adventure. The game's ambitious port to the Nintendo Switch showcases the immense potential, but the constant juggling of mechanics may not be for everyone. Nevertheless, if you invest the time, you'll find yourself immersed in a grounded and enjoyable trial and error gameplay, making it another 'impossible port' worth experiencing on the go for Switch owners.",
