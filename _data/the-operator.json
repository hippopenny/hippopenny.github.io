Well, let me tell you, it's not a mythical creature that only lives on Mars (although, that would be pretty cool). No, no, my friends! A grok is simply a type of video game where you get to solve some serious puzzles and play the role of a secret agent trying to uncover a conspiracy. And trust me, this game delivers!<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna lie... I was initially skeptical about The Operator. I mean, it's another puzzle game, right? How many of those do we really need? But, oh boy! This one's got some serious mojo working for it. It starts off strong, with a gripping story that'll keep you hooked from the very beginning. You'll be solving phone records, enhancing security footage, and tiptoeing through enemy bases like a pro (or at least, that's what I tell myself when I'm playing).<br><br>The Operator's got some top-notch puzzle design too! It never feels too easy or too hard... just right! You'll find yourself scratching your head one minute, and then BAM! The answer hits you like a ton of bricks. And the best part? It doesn't get old fast! Each new case brings its own unique set of challenges to keep you on your toes.<br><br>Now, I know some critics might say, \"Hey, it's not the longest game out there.\" And to that, I say... who needs 20 hours of gameplay when you can have a solid 5 hours packed with non-stop excitement? The Operator might be short and sweet, but trust me, it's the perfect length for what it is.<br><br>So, in conclusion... Hippo Penny - The Operator's got some serious grok (get it? I know, I know). If you're a fan of puzzle games, immersive storytelling, or just looking for something new to play, this one's definitely worth checking out. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some phone records to solve...<br><br>References:<br>Twinfinite - 90/100<br>The Games Machine - 85/100<br>Game Rant - 80/100<br>God is a Geek - 80/100<br>GameSpew - 80/100<br>Destructoid - 70/100<br>PCGamesN - 60/100",
