As I dove into this free-to-play gatcha game, I couldn't help but think of those pesky reviewers who say things like \"It's got some great combat!\" and \"The exploration is so much fun!\" Yeah, sure, those are nice features, but what about the story? And don't even get me started on that voice acting...<br><br>Let's start with Movies Games and Tech, who gave Wuthering Waves a solid 70. They praised the game's combat and exploration aspects, but dinged it for its weak story and subpar voice acting. I mean, come on, folks! You can't just patch up the narrative like a quick fix job and expect us to buy into it (pun intended).<br><br>GamingBolt also chimed in with a 70, saying that Wuthering Waves won't unseat Genshin Impact anytime soon. But hey, at least they're acknowledging the game's solid foundation.<br><br>Meanwhile, But Why Tho? got a little harsher with their 50 score, calling out the game's numerous problems. Yeah, I get it - Wuthering Waves has its issues. But don't we all?<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, INVEN gave Wuthering Waves an 85, praising its fast-paced action and attractive graphics (even if the storyline is a bit lacking). They're banking on future refinements to take the game to the next level.<br><br>GLHF on Sports Illustrated also weighed in with a 70, saying that Wuthering Waves feels like an outdated copy of Genshin Impact. Ouch! But hey, at least they acknowledge its strengths - and who knows, maybe it'll find its own identity someday?<br><br>Last but not least, Jeuxvideo.com gave Wuthering Waves a 75, highlighting its advanced action gameplay and artistic direction. However, they were disappointed by the French translation (oops). It's like Kuro Games took all the right notes from Genshin Impact, but still managed to create something uniquely... meh.<br><br>So what's my take on Wuthering Waves? Well, I think it's got some great bones to work with, but those pesky issues need addressing. If you're looking for a fast-paced action game and an open world to explore, Wuthering Waves might be worth your time. But if you're all about the story, you might want to wait and see how things develop.<br><br>All in all, Wuthering Waves is like that one friend who's still trying to find their identity - they've got some great qualities, but need a little more polish before shining bright. Or, as my grandma would say: \"A little bit of work, a lot of love, and you'll be golden!\"",
