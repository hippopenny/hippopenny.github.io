I mean, who doesn't love a good open-world action RPG with gacha elements? Am I right or am I right?<br><br>So, let me get this straight - Wuthering Waves is trying to be like Genshin Impact, but...better. And honestly, it's not a bad effort! The combat is solid (no pun intended), and the exploration aspect is actually kinda fun. I mean, who doesn't love running around an open world, slicing up monsters and collecting loot?<br><br>But let's get real for a sec - Wuthering Waves has its flaws. The story? Meh. It's weak, guys. Like, \"I'm going to save the world from certain doom\" kind of weak. And don't even get me started on the voice acting. Subpar is being kind.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"But [Reviewer Name], what about the other critics?\" Ah, yes! The other critics! Well, let me tell you, they're a mixed bag (get it? Bag? Like gacha? Okay, moving on).<br><br>Movies Games and Tech says Wuthering Waves is worth playing in the long run, but the story needs work. GamingBolt gives it a solid 70, saying it's not as good as Genshin Impact, but still worth checking out. But Why Tho?'s review is all over the place - they like some parts of the game, but hate others.<br><br>INVEN, on the other hand, thinks Wuthering Waves has potential with its fast-paced action and attractive graphics...despite a weak storyline. GLHF on Sports Illustrated (yeah, that's what it says) calls out the game for trying too hard to be like Genshin Impact and not being true to itself.<br><br>And finally, Jeuxvideo.com gives Wuthering Waves 75 points, saying it tries to compete with Genshin Impact but ultimately fails due to a bad French translation (because, you know, priorities).<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I think Wuthering Waves has some redeeming qualities - that combat is actually pretty fun, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable. But yeah, the story needs work, and let's be real, those voice acting issues need to be addressed ASAP.<br><br>If you're looking for a fast-paced action game with a deep open world, I'd recommend giving Wuthering Waves a shot...but don't say I didn't warn you about that weak storyline. Hippo Penny out!",
