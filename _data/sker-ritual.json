But before we do, I just want to say that I'm a seasonal reviewer, which means I'm only as good as my last review – so if this one stinks, it's because I stink, got it? Okay, moving on!<br><br>First off, Sker Ritual is like the cool cousin of COD: Zombies. You know, the one who's always down for a good time, but maybe not quite as polished. The game's round-based horde shooter design is genuinely entertaining, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a glutton for punishment (although, let's be real, 20 hours of straight gaming will do that to anyone). Seriously though, Sker Ritual has some strong bones beneath its rough exterior.<br><br>Now, about those rough edges – yeah, there are some issues. The balancing act is a bit off, sound design could use some work, and don't even get me started on the technical issues (I mean, come on, who doesn't love a good game-breaking glitch every now and then?). But hey, if you're willing to look past those imperfections and are a fan of COD: Zombies, Sker Ritual might just be your cup of tea.<br><br>Gamereactor UK agrees, saying it's \"a solid hoard shooter that is certain to impress Call of Duty Zombies fans.\" I mean, who am I to argue with their wisdom? Meanwhile, Digitally Downloaded seems a bit miffed, claiming the game lacks an identity and feels like a quick cash-grab. Well, I'm not one to judge (much), but even if that's true, isn't it better to have a fun, albeit shallow, experience than nothing at all?<br><br>PlayStation Universe gives Sker Ritual a nod of approval for its good bones and ease of play, despite some rough edges. GameSpew agrees, highlighting the impressive enemy variety, map themes, and rewarding mechanics – even if things can get a bit overwhelming at times.<br><br>And then there's The Jimquisition, who... well, let's just say they're not exactly thrilled with Sker Ritual. Something about it being \"terribly balanced\" and \"broken in several ways\"? Yeah, maybe that's why I'm a seasonal reviewer instead of the next big thing (although, honestly, I'm good with my current gig – fewer existential crises).<br><br>So, if you're looking for a fun co-op shooter to kill some zombies and have a blast (see what I did there?), Sker Ritual might be worth checking out. Just don't expect it to be perfect, because let's face it, what game is?",
