A game that's got everyone from GameGrin to Hey Poor Player excited, and not just because of its adorable heroes (although, let's be real, who doesn't love a cute cat in a hoverboard?).<br><br>GameGrin gives it 95/100, calling it an \"amazing character action game\" with a \"cute, creepy, and carnage-filled\" experience. Sector.sk agrees, saying the cat on the hoverboard is a tough hero that'll keep you hooked.<br><br>But things take a turn for the worse with Tech-Gaming's review, where they say Gori: Cuddly Carnage is like Frankenstein's monster - stitched together from various game concepts, but somehow working. Slant Magazine gives it 70/100, saying expert gamers might find it lacking, but everyone else will have a blast.<br><br>And then there's Hey Poor Player, the scrooge of critics, giving it 60/100 and saying it's not even worth mentioning how little depth this game has. But let's be honest, when you've got a cat on a hoverboard, who needs depth?<br><br>As for me? Well, I'll just say that Gori: Cuddly Carnage is a fun romp that knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else (except maybe a deep story or engaging characters - sorry, Hey Poor Player). It's a chaotic game filled with over-the-top violence and juvenile humor. So if you're looking for something silly and entertaining, Gori: Cuddly Carnage might just scratch that itch!<br><br>(And don't worry if it gets stuck on your Steam Deck. We won't judge.)",
