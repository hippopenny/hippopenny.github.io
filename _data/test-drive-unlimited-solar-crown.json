With a whopping 12 critics on board, their reviews are as varied as the neon-lit streets of Hong Kong Island. But fear not, dear gamers, for I've got the highlights, lowlights, and enough witty banter to keep you entertained until the next episode.<br><br>God is a Geek gave it a solid 75 out of 100, praising the game's endless possibilities and challenges, regardless of your skill level. GameGrin chimed in with a 70, noting that Solar Crown has some way to go before joining the open-world racing elite, but they're off to a decent start.<br><br>But, oh no! Gamereactor UK had other ideas altogether, awarding it a 70 as well, stating that Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown can't quite dethrone Forza Horizon from its throne. However, there's still plenty of fun content waiting for those who feel like taking on the virtual roads.<br><br>GamingBolt shared similar sentiments, with their own 70, mentioning that Solar Crown doesn't quite live up to other open-world racing games in recent years but is still an enjoyable driving experience. And let's not forget Push Square, which awarded it a delightful 60 despite some technical issues and underwhelming expectations for the lifestyle elements!<br><br>But wait, there's more! Eurogamer Portugal also chimed in with their own 60, saying that even great ideas are hampered by technical quality and design decisions. Lastly, VGC concluded with an identical score and sentiment, acknowledging it as a fun open-world racing game but lacking innovation.<br><br>So what does this mean? Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown is like the new kid on the block who's eager to show off their driving skills! It may stumble upon some speed bumps along the way, but hey, at least they're trying!<br><br>Ultimately (dramatic music plays), it comes down to how much you value having a good time with an enjoyable driving experience. Solar Crown is that friend who always picks you up and says, \"Hop in, buddy! We'll take this ride across Hong Kong Island together!\"<br><br>There you have it, folks - Hippo Penny's verdict (which doesn't actually count, let's be clear): if you're hankering for an open-world racing game, Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has your name on its racing licenses.",
