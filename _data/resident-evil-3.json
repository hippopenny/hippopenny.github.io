    "comment": "Resident Evil 3 delivers a spine-chilling survival horror experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Despite some shortcomings compared to its predecessor, it still manages to captivate with its exhilarating storyline and gameplay. The addition of the REsistance online mode adds value for those who enjoy competitive play, and the classic Resident Evil tone is skillfully balanced with modern gameplay elements. While it may not reach the heights of its predecessor, it's still a thrilling return to Raccoon City for franchise faithfuls.",
