Bakeru, the highly anticipated Japanese-style action platformer, has finally got its fair share of attention from some top-notch critics. Let's dive in and see what all the fuss is about!<br><br>According to TouchArcade, Bakeru is \"a highly endearing little 3D platformer\" with a well-polished design and plenty of fun ideas to spice things up during its relatively lengthy adventure. And I gotta give it to them, that does sound pretty captivating! However, they also mention some framerate issues on the Switch version that kept this from being truly exceptional.<br><br>Meanwhile, CGMagazine seems to be absolutely loving Bakeru, saying \"BAKERU blends smooth platforming with incredible combat...to create one of the most fun games I’ve played in a while.\" Wow, talk about a glowing review!<br><br>Of course, we can't forget about our Spanish-speaking friends over at Hobby Consolas. They gave Bakeru an 85, praising its charming simplicity and wonderful representation of Japanese culture. And I've got to agree, that's definitely worth a mention or three.<br><br>I also love what Pure Nintendo said about Bakeru being \"a light-hearted action game\" with plenty to learn and do throughout its many levels. Okay, so maybe it won't win any awards for originality, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun!<br><br>On the other hand, Worth Playing gave it an 80, saying Bakeru is a cute and accessible game, perfect for kids (and let's be honest, some adults too!). But don't worry; they also mention its repetitive combat and occasionally poor performance as potential drawbacks.<br><br>And finally, we've got Nintendo Life with their review of Bakeru being \"a sweet, snappy, and satisfying linear 3D platformer.\" Okay, so maybe it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but at least it feels like something from good old Goemon days!<br><br>Last but not least, I found a negative review from Cubed3 saying that Bakeru suffers from repetitive gameplay and poor frame rates. Who knew we needed someone to balance out all this hype?<br><br>There you have it, folks; my own two cents on the state of Bakeru reviews! Let me know what you think in the comments below – if you've played it yourself or just want to give your two pence on these fabulous games. Happy gaming!",
