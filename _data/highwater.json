    "comment": "Highwater offers a well-made turn-based battler set in a visually stunning post-apocalyptic world. With solid tactical gameplay and charming characters, it's a great little game for fans of the genre. However, the short length and lack of collectible tracking may leave some players wanting more. Despite these flaws, players will get lost in the beautiful tragedy of it all.",
