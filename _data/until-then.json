As a seasoned grok (get it? like a hippo in the penny-farthings?), I'm excited to share my thoughts on this narrative-focused game.<br><br>First off, let me say that these critics are a chatty bunch, aren't they? Eighty-score-or-bust seems to be the consensus among the likes of Checkpoint Gaming, GameSkinny, COGconnected, The Indie Informer, and Eurogamer. Slant Magazine gave it a more modest 70, but New Game Network was the sole dissenting voice with its 57.<br><br>Now, let's get to the good stuff! As I waded through Until Then's pixelated waters, I found myself swept up in the characters' lives. Mark and his gang are an endearing bunch, and their stories will tug at your heartstrings. The game's writing is thoughtful and authentic, capturing the essence of life as a teenager in the Philippines in the 2010s.<br><br>The visuals? Absolutely breathtaking! Who wouldn't want to explore a picturesque world filled with pixelated charm?<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without a healthy dose of criticism. New Game Network's 57 is well-deserved, in my humble opinion. The pacing can feel mundane at times, and the interactivity is limited to say the least. But hey, that's what makes Until Then so... relatable? It's like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces â€“ you'll still appreciate the effort, even if it doesn't quite fit together.<br><br>In conclusion, Until Then is a must-play for anyone who loves narrative-focused games (yes, I'm looking at you, fellow groks!). With its beautiful world, thoughtful writing, and endearing characters, this game will leave you with an emotional gut punch that'll stay with you long after the credits roll. So go ahead, take the plunge, and let the Until Then adventure sweep you off your feet!",
