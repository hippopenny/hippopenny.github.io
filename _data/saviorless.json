    "comment": "Saviorless delivers a dark and intense platforming experience with a captivating narrative that will leave you conflicted. The intentionally frustrating controls and merciless puzzles may test your patience, but the fantastic story and intriguing metafiction elements make it a worthwhile journey. Despite its flaws, Saviorless marks a promising start for indie developer Empty Head Games, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.",
