    "comment": "Helldivers 2 brings bombastic co-op fun and hilarity, but watch out for the matchmaking bugs and crashes. It's a riotous affair that offers top-notch gunplay and a genuinely epic experience, but its longevity and variety are still in question. The game respects your time and money with a sensible price tag, but it's best enjoyed with a full squad of friends. If you're up for a challenge and love cooperative shooters, Helldivers 2 will monopolize your leisure time and provide a fantastic time for a good season.",
