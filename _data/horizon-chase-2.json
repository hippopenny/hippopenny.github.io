More on that later.<br><br>First off, let me just say that this game is a blast â€“ literally and figuratively! It's like a high-speed rollercoaster ride for your senses ( minus the actual rollercoaster part, sadly). The visuals are stunning, with vibrant colors and sleek graphics that'll make you feel like you're racing through the streets of Tokyo... or whatever city you prefer.<br><br>Now, I know some critics have said it's not exactly deep or varied. And to that, I say: \"Hey, what's wrong with a little mindless fun every now and then?\" Sometimes, we just want to strap ourselves into our favorite virtual ride and go \"Wheeee!\" (Or in this case, \"Vroom!\"). Horizon Chase 2 delivers on that front.<br><br>But, of course, no review would be complete without a quick nod to some of the other critics out there. So, let's see what the likes of Gaming Nexus had to say:<br><br>\"Good track design and a blistering sense of speed are not enough to compensate for relatively mindless racing.\"<br><br>Uh-huh. Yeah, because we all know that \"mindless racing\" is basically just code for \"too much fun\". And I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the good folks at Gaming Nexus were trying to say...<br><br>And then there's Push Square:<br><br>\"Outside of the core campaign, there's online multiplayer with full crossplay... Rotating challenges also offer new gameplay wrinkles and modifiers to keep things fresh...\"<br><br>Okay, so maybe this one isn't being too snarky. But hey, even when they're not being snarky, it's nice to have some actual game details to work with!<br><br>Of course, we can't forget about the high-honors folks at PlayStation Universe:<br><br>\"Horizon Chase 2 is a phenomenal package for arcade racing game fans... This feels like the definitive arcade racing experience...\"<br><br>Wow. Just... wow. I mean, what more could you ask for in an arcade racing game? It's like they're speaking straight to my heart (or at least, the part of my brain that controls my gaming preferences)!<br><br>And finally, we have some more positive vibes from GameSpew and IGN Spain:<br><br>\"Bigger and better than its predecessor... Its sensational sense of speed and new weather effects in particular make it stand out...\"<br><br>\"Horizon Chase 2 offers a classic arcade experience... A direct, beautiful, fun and simple racing arcade.\"<br><br>Yeah, I think we can safely say that these two are on the same wavelength as me (and most players out there).<br><br>As for the low-scoring folks at PlayStation Country:<br><br>\"It's not exactly deep or varied but Horizon Chase 2 pretty much injects high-speed racing fun directly into your veins...\"<br><br>Well, I suppose they're right about it being fun... But come on! Who doesn't love a little bit of mindless fun every now and then?<br><br>Anyway, that's my take on Horizon Chase 2. It's a blast (see what I did there?), with some minor caveats. If you're a fan of arcade racing games or just looking for something to pass the time, this one's definitely worth checking out. And hey, even if it's not exactly deep or varied... sometimes that's exactly what we need!",
