Today, we're diving into the world of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, a game that has critics going wild (see what I did there?).<br><br>Now, before I start, let me just say that I'm not a critic who likes to bash games just for the sake of it. No way! I'm all about having fun and poking fun at myself (and others) in the process. So, without further ado, let's get into this review!<br><br>First off, what's Intergrade? Well, it's an upgraded version of Final Fantasy VII Remake that includes the original game, as well as some new DLC content called INTERmission. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Why do I care about a PS5 remaster?\" Well, let me tell you – this game is like a fine wine (or in my case, a mediocre beer). It only gets better with age!<br><br>But enough about that. What about the gameplay? Oh boy, oh boy! It's like Square Enix took all the best parts of FF7 and made it even more beautiful (pun intended). The combat is still ridiculously fun, the graphics are stunning, and the new haptic feedback feature is... well, let's just say it's a mixed bag. I mean, who doesn't love a good rumble in their controller? But, seriously, it's not for everyone.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the critics?\" Ah, yes! Let me tell you – they're a special bunch. GameSpot gave it a 100% (I mean, come on!), while Worth Playing gave it a more realistic 90% (thank goodness for some balance). Vandal and GamingTrend also joined in with their 90% scores, while Destructoid and Hardcore Gamer scored it an 80%. And Metro GameCentral? Well, they're the wild card – giving it an 80% but saying it's not essential (ouch!).<br><br>So, what does all this mean? It means that Intergrade is a solid package with some great new content. But, let's be real – if you've already played FF7 Remake, you might not need to upgrade just yet. Unless, of course, you're like me and love trying out new features (like haptic feedback... or not).<br><br>That's it for today! I hope you enjoyed this review as much as I did (or at least tolerated it). If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out – Hippo Penny loves hearing from readers!<br><br>And remember: don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe (just kidding... or am I?). See you in the next review!",
