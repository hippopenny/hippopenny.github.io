It's your boy back with another review that's sure to make you laugh, cry, and possibly speedrun the NES edition of Nintendo World Championship!<br><br>First off, let's get the obligatory roast out of the way. I'm not gonna lie, some of these critics are so soft, they'll give you a participation trophy just for showing up. Case in point: IGN Italia says this game is \"a bit pricey\" but still manages to find room for a lengthy paragraph about game design. Newsflash, IGN Italia: nobody wants to read 500 words about game design when there's speedrunning to be done!<br><br>But seriously, folks, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition is a wild ride that will test your skills, challenge you, and make you wanna shout at the screen, \"I'M GONNA GET THAT PERFECT RUN, MOM!\" (Or maybe that's just me.)<br><br>The critics are generally pretty stoked about this one. TheSixthAxis gives it a 90 out of 100, saying it's \"a fantastic way to discover or reminisce over the titles that formed the basis for many of the franchises that still dominate gaming today.\" I mean, who doesn't love a good dose of nostalgia?<br><br>Atomix agrees, calling it \"super fun\" and stating that \"the way everything is presented results in a great videogame that everyone can enjoy.\" Even Siliconera, who's typically not afraid to trash games, says the game has \"a lot of atmosphere\" – which I take to mean the NES edition's retro vibes are on point.<br><br>Now, I know some of you speedrunners out there are thinking, \"Uh-oh, does this game have any real-time multiplayer?\" Well, let me tell you, Meristation's got your back: they're saying the lack of real-time multiplayer is what keeps it from going further. You can't blame 'em; who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned competition?<br><br>As for Checkpoint Gaming, they're saying this game is all about speedrunning, which is true – but also kinda a bummer? I mean, what if you're not into practicing well into the night to shave milliseconds off your record? It's like Digital Trends says: \"it feels more like practice than the big game itself.\" (Yeah, okay, maybe that's just me again.)<br><br>And finally, there's the critic who's just straight-up hating on this game. I'm talking about Siliconera, who says it's \"held together by sentiment and atmosphere\" – which is basically code for \"I hate this game.\"<br><br>But you know what? I think that's kind of brilliant. Maybe Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition isn't trying to be some grand, sprawling masterpiece; maybe it's just a fun little party trick. And if that's the case, then I'm all in!<br><br>So there you have it – my review is wrapped up like a nice little present! What do you think, folks? Are you ready to join the Nintendo World Championship speedrunning frenzy? Let me know in the comments below!",
