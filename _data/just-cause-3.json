Sure, the performance bugs may rain on your explosive parade, but the sheer potential for free-form mayhem and outlandish stunts makes it a game worth playing. It's a stunning display of cause and effect, where you can orchestrate outlandish chain reactions and watch the world explode into fiery blossoms. Sure, it may show some limitations and technical issues when played in a straight way, but if you embrace the absurdity and create your own experience, you'll find pure, untarnished fun waiting for you. So grab your rocket cows and dive into this beautiful nation filled with cheeky humor and endless possibilities!",
