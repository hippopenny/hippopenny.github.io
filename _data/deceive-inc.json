And by \"everyone,\" I mean me, because I'm the only one who matters.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: what makes this game so special? Well, for starters, it's not your average run-and-gun shooter. No, no, no! This game is all about strategy, stealth, and a dash of humor (mainly mine, but still). You see, Deceive Inc. is all about deception – hence the name. It's like a big game of cat and mouse, where you have to use your wits to outsmart your opponents and complete objectives.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Let's check in with some other critics who've had their say on Deceive Inc. Ah, yes... PC Gamer gave it an 82, saying that it's a \"creative blend of sneaking and shooting\" (I mean, who wouldn't want to combine those two things?). The Games Machine chimed in with an 80, praising the game's unique approach to multiplayer. And Shacknews? They gave it a solid 70, calling it a \"refreshing change of pace from the usual deathmatch shooter.\"<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: this all sounds very nice and dandy... but what about the criticisms? Ah, yes... GameSkinny took Deceive Inc. to task for its lackluster player base and frustrating matches (I mean, who hasn't had a match or two where they just want to throw their controller out the window?). And NME? They gave it an 80, but noted that the progression system can be a bit wonky.<br><br>But here's the thing: I think Deceive Inc. is actually pretty great... and not just because I'm trying to curry favor with the developers (although, let's be real, they do make some awesome games). No, no! It's because this game has something that so many others lack: originality. It's like a breath of fresh air in a sea of shooters and battle royals.<br><br>So, there you have it – my two cents on Deceive Inc. Will it be the next big thing? I don't know... but what I do know is that it's definitely worth checking out. And if all else fails, you can always just watch me play it and laugh at my misadventures (just kidding... or am I?).
