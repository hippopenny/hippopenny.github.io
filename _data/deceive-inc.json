You know, the kind that make you go \"aha!\" when your friends ask how you managed to sneak up on them and steal their loot.<br><br>PC Gamer agrees, giving it a solid 82 for its creative blend of sneaking and shooting. I'm no expert, but I think they might be onto something. Who doesn't love a good game of cat-and-mouse?<br><br>The Games Machine (80) seems to think that Deceive Inc.'s stealth approach sets it apart from the usual multiplayer fare. And while I wouldn't go so far as to call it \"revolutionary,\" it's definitely fun to play around with.<br><br>Shacknews (70) points out some bugs, but overall, they're all about embracing the game's quirks and enjoying the ride. Same here - when Deceive Inc. is good, it's REALLY good. But when it's not... well, let's just say I had my fair share of frustrating matches.<br><br>TheGamer (70) is a bit more mixed, mentioning that while solo mode is fun, multiplayer mode is still on the horizon for them. Fingers crossed that they get to experience the full Deceive Inc. experience soon!<br><br>GameSkinny (60) takes it easy on Deceive Inc., acknowledging its potential but lamenting the player base's tendency to, well, shoot first and ask questions later. I mean, who doesn't love a good excuse for some friendly fire?<br><br>NME (80) loves the game despite its minor annoyances - and honestly, who can blame them? When you're having fun sneaking up on your pals, you won't mind a thing.<br><br>All in all, Deceive Inc.'s got potential. It's not without its quirks and frustrations, but when it clicks, it's pure gold. So if you're looking for some good ol' fashioned multiplayer shenanigans with a hint of sneaky spy action, give it a go!",
