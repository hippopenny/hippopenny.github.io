As a seasonal grok video game reviewer, I've got my wits about me and a healthy dose of humor to keep things light.<br><br>Let's start with what everyone wants to know: is it fun? Absolutely! Deceive Inc. has a sneaky-good blend of sneaking and shooting that will have you and your squad coming back for more. But don't just take my word for it – or the words of PC Gamer, who gave it an 82, saying it's \"a creative blend of sneaking and shooting that will have squads coming back for more.\" Yeah, we're on the same page there.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the competition?\" And to that, I say, Deceive Inc. is trying something new – a stealthy approach in a genre dominated by loud and proud multiplayer games. The Games Machine agrees, giving it an 80, saying it's \"a more stealth approach... the formula is successful and the matches are a lot of fun...\" Yeah, we get it – this game is different, and that's what makes it interesting.<br><br>Of course, not everyone is convinced. Shacknews gave it a 70, saying it's \"a multiplayer game like few others right now...\" They're right; Deceive Inc. does offer something unique, even if it's not without its bugs (more on that in a bit). And then there's TheGamer, who also gave it a 70, saying it's \"fun enough that I immediately started asking my friends to play with me.\" Yeah, no surprise there – when the gameplay is this good, you want to share it with your friends.<br><br>Now, about those bugs. GameSkinny wasn't too impressed, giving it a 60 and complaining about frustrating matches caused by players not getting the concept of stealthy gameplay. I get where they're coming from; sometimes it's hard to keep those guns quiet. But hey, that's all part of the fun, right?<br><br>Finally, we have NME, who gave Deceive Inc. an 80, saying it's \"a fantastic multiplayer game... hamstrung with confusing progression and some minor annoyances...\" Yeah, yeah – I know what they mean by \"confusing progression.\" It's like trying to figure out the perfect spy disguise; sometimes it takes a few tries (or a few bugs squashed) to get it just right.<br><br>All in all, Deceive Inc. is a game worth keeping an eye on. With its fresh take on multiplayer gameplay and plenty of fun to be had, it's definitely one to add to your radar. And hey, if you're feeling extra adventurous, go ahead and give those bugs a try – after all, that's what beta testing is for, right?",
