As a seasoned grok video game reviewer, I'm here to give you the lowdown on this sneaky multiplayer game that's got everyone talking.<br><br>First off, let me say that Deceive Inc. is no ordinary multiplayer game. It's like a ninja in the night – stealthy, silent, and deadly (but not literally, don't worry). This game is all about strategy, teamwork, and, of course, deceiving your opponents. You see, you're part of an elite team of spies (or whatever they call themselves), and it's up to you to complete objectives without getting caught by the bad guys (AKA other players).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – \"Is this game just a rehash of Call of Duty with a fancy name?\" Well, let me tell you, my friend, Deceive Inc. is anything but that. It's got its own unique charm and style, like a hipster in a fixed-gear bike shop. And honestly, I'm kind of loving it.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it – the critics are also raving about this game! PC Gamer gives it an 82, saying it's \"a creative blend of sneaking and shooting that will have squads coming back for more.\" The Games Machine agrees, giving it a 80 and saying it's a \"stealth approach\" that's \"a lot of fun.\"<br><br>Of course, not everyone is on board. Shacknews gives it a 70, saying it's a \"refreshing change of pace from the usual deathmatch shooter,\" but also notes some bugs (boo!). And GameSkinny gives it a 60, saying it's \"not doing too hot\" and that the player base needs to grow for the game to truly thrive.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – \"What about NME? What did they say?\" Well, let me tell you, my friend, NME gives Deceive Inc. an 80, saying it's a \"fantastic multiplayer game hamstrung with confusing progression and some minor annoyances.\" Yeah, that sounds about right.<br><br>So, in conclusion, Deceive Inc. is a game that's all about strategy, teamwork, and deception (duh). It's got its own unique charm, and while it may not be perfect (who is?), it's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something new and different in the multiplayer space.<br><br>And remember, folks – Hippo Penny's reviews are always 100% grok- approved!",
