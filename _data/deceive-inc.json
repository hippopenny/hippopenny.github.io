Sounds like a plan to me! But, did this game succeed in making me feel like a top-notch spy? Let's find out.<br><br>I won't sugarcoat it; Deceive Inc. has some minor issues, but those aren't enough to ruin the experience. I love how the game combines sneaking and shooting – it's like having two favorite foods, pizza and tacos, combined into one delicious meal! The formula works, making matches a blast, even if they can be a tad short.<br><br>Some critics have pointed out the lack of content (The Games Machine), but honestly, I was too busy having fun to notice. If you're looking for a change of pace from the usual deathmatch shooter, Deceive Inc. is a refreshing alternative. It's like finding that one cool cousin at the family reunion – you don't always see them, but when you do, it's all good (Shacknews).<br><br>Now, let's get to the nitty-gritty. TheGamer mentioned some bugs, and I agree – there were a few times where I had to restart because of a pesky glitch. But, solo mode was so much fun that I didn't even notice! I'm hoping the devs fix those issues ASAP, or they'll be losing me (and probably others) as potential players.<br><br>GameSkinny's review really resonated with me – it's not just about the game mechanics; it's also about the people playing them. When you give players guns, some of them will, well, let their hair down and get a little reckless. I mean, who hasn't had that one friend who thinks they're Rambo? Anyway, it did take away from my experience, but it wasn't all bad.<br><br>Lastly, NME gave me the feels – Deceive Inc. is a fantastic multiplayer game hamstrung with... wait for it... confusing progression! Minor annoyances aside, this game won't mind if you don't vibe with it at first. Give it some time, and I'm sure you'll find yourself slipping into that spy life.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny says Deceive Inc. is a fun-filled ride with some minor issues that can be overlooked. If you're looking for something new in the multiplayer scene, this game might just do the trick!",
