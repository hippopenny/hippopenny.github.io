And by everyone, I mean me, because I'm the only critic who really matters. Okay, fine, the other guys on this list matter too, but let's be real, my review is gonna be way more fun.<br><br>So, what's Deceive Inc. all about? Well, it's like a real-life game of hide-and-seek, except instead of hiding from your friends, you're sneaking around with your squad to take down the enemy team. And by \"sneaking around,\" I mean running around in ridiculous outfits while trying not to get caught.<br><br>The formula works, folks! Deceive Inc. is a blast when you're playing with a good crew, and the matches are a lot of fun. But let's talk about what's missing – more content, please! We need more maps, modes, and maybe even some sweet dance moves to spice things up.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, why are you being so harsh on Deceive Inc.?\" Well, let me tell you, it's because I'm a tough critic (wink). But honestly, I just want the game to reach its full potential. And if that means poking fun at myself and the other critics (cough, cough), then so be it.<br><br>Shoutouts to PC Gamer for giving Deceive Inc. an 82 – nice! The Games Machine was right on the money with their 80 score too. Shacknews and TheGamer both gave it a solid 70, and GameSkinny... well, they were a bit harsh (just kidding, I love 'em).<br><br>In all seriousness, Deceive Inc. is an awesome game that's worth playing, but it needs a little more juice to really take off. So, what are you waiting for? Go grab some friends, put on your best spy outfit, and get ready to deceive (get it?) the competition!<br><br>Stay groovy, gamers!",
