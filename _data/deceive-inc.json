As I dive into the world of sneaking and shooting, I'm reminded why I love being a seasonal grok video game reviewer - it's all about having fun and poking fun at my fellow critics!<br><br>Let me start by saying that Deceive Inc. is no ordinary multiplayer game. It's a creative blend of stealth and action that will keep you on your toes (or should I say, on your sneak?)! As PC Gamer aptly put it, \"A creative blend of sneaking and shooting that will have squads coming back for more.\"<br><br>I do agree with The Games Machine when they say that Deceive Inc. is successful in its formula - the matches are a lot of fun! However, I also think that some critics might be too harsh on the game's lack of content and premium season. After all, as NME so charmingly puts it, \"Deceive Inc. is a fantastic multiplayer game hamstrung with confusing progression and some minor annoyances.\"<br><br>Shacknews is right on the mark when they say that Deceive Inc. is a refreshing change of pace from the usual deathmatch shooter. It's creative, both visually and conceptually, and something worth watching (or in this case, playing)! And let me tell you, solo mode is just as much fun!<br><br>On the other hand, GameSkinny might be a bit too harsh on Deceive Inc. While I agree that there are some frustrating matches, it's not entirely the game's fault - sometimes, players just need to learn the ropes! As TheGamer so kindly puts it, \"Here\\u2019s hoping that the game fixes its many bugs quickly, because there\\u2019s plenty else to love about this game as long as they build on the base they\\u2019ve started with.\"<br><br>All in all, Deceive Inc. is a fantastic multiplayer game that's definitely worth checking out! With some minor annoyances and room for improvement, it's got a lot of potential to be even more awesome. And hey, who knows? Maybe those pesky bugs will get ironed out, and we'll see an influx of players eager to join the fun!<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Grab your best spy gear (or not), and dive into the world of Deceive Inc.! Trust me, it's a blast!",
