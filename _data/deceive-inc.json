You know what they say: if at first you don't succeed, try, try again... or in this case, just go ahead and deceive everyone around you . The blend of sneaking and shooting is indeed creative, and it's a breath of fresh air to play a game that doesn't immediately throw you into a deathmatch.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the critics? Well, let me tell you, they seem to agree that Deceive Inc. is a fun experience... with some caveats. PC Gamer gave it an 82 and praised its creative approach, while The Games Machine awarded it 80 points, saying the game needs more content and variety.<br><br>Shacknews chimed in with a 70, praising the game's creativity and visual appeal. And NME? They loved the multiplayer aspect, giving it 80 points for being \"a fantastic multiplayer game.\" On the other hand, GameSkinny scored it a lowly 60, citing frustrating matches caused by players not grasping the concepts... because, you know, people love to shoot things.<br><br>TheGamer, meanwhile, enjoyed solo mode and gave Deceive Inc. a decent score for its bugs (and lack of multiplayer action).<br><br>All in all, I think we have a game that's worth watching - or rather, playing - with some caveats. The mechanics are there, the creativity is there... but can it sustain a player base? That remains to be seen.<br><br>So, if you're looking for something new and different in the multiplayer space, Deceive Inc. might just be the ticket. Just don't forget to read the instructions (or not) and try to deceive those pesky AI agents!<br><br>That's all for now - stay groovy, gamers!",
