I mean, don't get me wrong - a good old-fashioned deathmatch can be fun every now and then, but sometimes I just want to chill with some friends and take down some bad guys without all the drama and toxic chat.<br><br>Enter Deceive Inc., which takes a refreshing approach by focusing on stealth and strategy rather than just shooting everything in sight. It's like the game is saying, \"Hey, you know what's more fun? Sneaking up on your enemies and taking them out quietly! \"<br><br>Of course, as with any multiplayer game, there are always going to be some naysayers who criticize it for one reason or another. I mean, check out what some of these other critics have said:<br><br>* PC Gamer: \"A creative blend of sneaking and shooting that will have squads coming back for more.\" (82) - Yeah, no kidding! It's like they're speaking my language!<br>* The Games Machine: \"Deceive Inc. strives to distinguish itself from the mass of competitive multiplayer with a more stealth approach... however more content and a premium season need to be added to offer the same variety as the kings of this genre do.\" (80) - Hey, I'm all for more content and variety in my games!<br>* Shacknews: \"Outside of some bugs, Deceive Inc. is a multiplayer game like few others right now... It's creative, both visually and conceptually, and something worth watching, because its best days may be ahead of it.\" (70) - Yeah, I'll give them that - the game does have some bugs, but hey, at least they're not as bad as some other games out there!<br>* TheGamer: \"Despite its bugs, Deceive Inc. is fun enough that I immediately started asking my friends to play with me... Here's hoping that the game fixes its many bugs quickly, because there's plenty else to love about this game.\" (70) - Same here! Let's just get those bugs fixed and enjoy the game already!<br>* GameSkinny: \"Deceive Inc. will live and die by its player base and so far, it's not doing too hot... The thing that's ruining the experience for me is something that's not technically a failure of any of the game's mechanics, but rather, a failure of those playing the game to grasp its concepts.\" (60) - Yeah, I get what you're saying - sometimes players just need to learn how to play the game properly!<br><br>But hey, at least one critic had some good things to say:<br><br>* NME: \"Deceive Inc. is a fantastic multiplayer game hamstrung with confusing progression and some minor annoyances that people who vibe with this spy-em-up won't mind a bit.\" (80) - Yeah, I'm all for games that are just a little bit quirky!<br><br>In conclusion, Deceive Inc. might not be perfect, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for something new and exciting. Just remember to keep an open mind and don't get too frustrated with those bugs!",
