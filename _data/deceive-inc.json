Alright, let's get this review party started!<br><br>I'm diving into Deceive Inc., a game that's got folks talking (or should I say, sneaking?) about its unique blend of stealth and shooting. But what does this critic (ahem, yours truly) think?<br><br>First off, the game's concept is fresh and fun - who doesn't love playing spies? The core mechanics are solid, with a great balance between sneaking around undetected and getting up close and personal with some tactical takedowns. I mean, what's not to love about taking down enemies silently with a well-placed sedative?<br><br>Now, let's address those pesky critics (wink). PC Gamer gave it an 82, saying it's a \"creative blend of sneaking and shooting\" that'll keep squads coming back for more. The Games Machine scored it an 80, praising the game's unique approach to competitive multiplayer and fun matches. Even NME chimed in with an 80, calling it a \"fantastic multiplayer game hamstrung with confusing progression.\"<br><br>Shacknews gave it a solid 70, saying Deceive Inc. is a refreshing change of pace from your average deathmatch shooter. TheGamer also scored it a 70, saying solo mode is fun enough to keep you coming back (and hoping the bugs get squashed).<br><br>And then there's GameSkinny, who dinged it with a 60, citing frustrating matches and a lack of player engagement. Now, I'm not gonna lie - I had some matches that were more about throwing punches than sneaking around like a pro. But hey, that's just part of the learning curve, right?<br><br>So what's my take on Deceive Inc.? It's a game that's all about strategy and teamwork (or going solo, if you're feeling extra sneaky). The core gameplay is solid, but it's those little things - like confusing progression or minor annoyances - that might keep it from reaching its full potential.<br><br>In the end, Deceive Inc. is a fun game that's worth checking out, especially if you're looking for something new and different in the competitive multiplayer space. Just remember to bring your A-game (and maybe some patience with those pesky bugs).<br><br>Stay classy, gamers!",
