Despite the added depth to the racing and new vehicle classes, the game struggles to break free from its predecessor's shadow. The multiplayer modes offer some variety, but the limited number of environments makes tracks feel tiresomely familiar. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but for arcade racing enthusiasts, it's still a thrilling ride.",
