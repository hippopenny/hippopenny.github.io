While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, the added depth to the racing and new vehicle classes bring a nice complexity to the game. The multiplayer modes offer more variety, but the lack of environments makes the tracks feel too familiar. Overall, it's a fuller gaming experience with more events and a story to enjoy, but it doesn't revolutionize the arcade racing genre. It's definitely worth a spin if you're a fan of toy-based racing games.",
