With added depth to the racing and new vehicle classes, burning plastic on orange tracks has never been more fun. Although the challenges and rewards could use a turbo boost, the multiplayer overhaul and expanded events offer a thrilling and frenetic racing game that keeps the pedal to the metal. It's not a drastic change from the original, but for fans of toy-based racing, this sequel takes the checkered flag.",
