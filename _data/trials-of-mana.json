It's your favorite hip-hop loving grok back with another delightful dish of digital delights. Today, I'm dishing out the lowdown on Square Enix's remake, Trials of Mana. So, grab your gaming glasses and get cozy!<br><br>First off, let me say that Noisy Pixel, the OG critic, hit the nail on the head with their 90/100 score. They're absolutely right - this game is unapologetically traditional, and still, it makes itself accessible to new and old JRPG fans alike. The developers' dedication to retaining the fantasy appeal of this classic title with updated systems shines, and every moment of this adventure feels like a warm hug for seasoned gamers.<br><br>Now, let's give some love to GameMAG, who gave Trials of Mana an 80. They're right; the English dubbing is subpar - but hey, maybe they were too busy sipping on some fancy cabernet sauvignon like Power Unlimited to notice? All jokes aside, GameMAG does have a point about the game's visuals being somewhat lackluster.<br><br>Meanwhile, RPG Site scored the remake an 80 as well. Their critique might be spot-on: despite some presentation issues and lacking difficulty, Trials of Mana is ultimately \"fantastic fun\" that delivers on its promises with confidence. The world of this game is indeed one you won't soon forget - but let's not get too caught up in nostalgia.<br><br>Power Unlimited's comparison between Trials of Mana and Final Fantasy VII Remake does make me chuckle, though! They're right; if the latter is a rich cabernet sauvignon, then TMA is more like that refreshing glass of lager you want to enjoy after the complexity of FFVII Remake.<br><br>Meristation gave Trials of Mana an 75 - and honestly, I think their assessment is pretty on-point. The original game's charm has been rehashed with a visual facelift; it's still \"as magical as ever.\" Not much more to say about that one!<br><br>On the other hand, Eurogamer Italy's 70 score does feel like they're being overly harsh. It's true that Trials of Mana was good...25 years ago? Yeah, it doesn't quite reach the new century wagon, but hey, what can you do? That's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.<br><br>And last - but certainly not least - we have Slant Magazine's 40 score. Now, I get what they're saying: the characters already lacked personality in the original game, and now it's even more apparent with this new visual design. Ouch! Maybe that one should've stayed on the backburner?<br><br>In conclusion, folks, Trials of Mana is a tasty dose of nostalgia served with a side of updated systems - just like your granny used to make ( minus the subpar dubbing, of course)! It's not perfect, but it's a fun ride for fans of classic JRPGs and old-school adventurers. What do you think? Let me know in the comments below!",
