Well, maybe not everyone, but certainly the critics I'll be poking fun at today.<br><br>Let's start with Slant Magazine, who gave it a score of 70. Now, I'm no linguist, but even I know that \"academic\" isn't exactly the most exciting adjective to describe a game. It's like saying a puzzle is \"interesting\"... yeah, sure, until you realize it's just a bunch of random shapes and colors on a screen.<br><br>Moving on to Worth Playing, who gave Chants of Sennaar an 80. Now, I love their review - they're all about the puzzles being \"interactive\" and \"creative\". I mean, what more could you want in a game? Oh wait, maybe some explosions or fast-paced action... but I digress.<br><br>SpazioGames chimes in with another 80, saying that Chants of Sennaar is an \"immersive puzzle game\" with \"a lot of riddles to discover\". Sounds like my kind of party!<br><br>God is a Geek, however, takes the cake for most enthusiastic reviewer. They're all about how this game makes you feel like a genius. I mean, who doesn't love being told they're a genius? (Asks self, looking in mirror.) Ah, right.<br><br>Now we have Hardcore Gamer's glowing review, where they praise Chants of Sennaar's \"well-crafted cultures\" and \"intricate puzzles\". Oh, and let me guess - the art of translation is now \"captivating gameplay\"? Yeah, because nothing says \"fun\" like staring at ancient texts all day.<br><br>Last but not least, we have TheSixthAxis and Noisy Pixel, both giving Chants of Sennaar an 80. They're all about how it explores relationships between people and cultures, which is super deep (see what I did there?). And hey, who doesn't love a good puzzle game that's \"simple to understand but complex to truly solve\"?<br><br>So, what does it all mean? Well, for me, Chants of Sennaar is a game that's all about the journey - not just solving puzzles, but exploring the world and its cultures. It's like a linguistic adventure! And who doesn't love a good adventure?<br><br>In conclusion... I think. Hippo Penny out!",
