Chants of Sennaar is a puzzle-adventure game that'll challenge your brain and make you feel like a genius. But enough about me; let's dive into what these fancy-pants critics are saying.<br><br>First off, Slant Magazine thinks this game is \"academic\" (ouch!), but I think they might be just trying to sound smart. Don't get me wrong – solving puzzles can be fascinating, especially when it comes to deciphering ancient languages and cultures! Who knows, maybe some of you linguistics majors out there will appreciate the linguistic anthropology lesson?<br><br>Worth Playing gives Chants of Sennaar an 80, praising its translation aspect and stealth elements. I mean, who doesn't love a good brain teaser or sneaky gameplay? It's like they say: \"A game that adventure fans will definitely enjoy!\" (yeah, yeah, we've heard it before).<br><br>SpazioGames chimes in with their own take, saying the game is \"good and immersive.\" I'm not sure what that means, but I think they're trying to be nice. Maybe they just like puzzles? Who knows?<br><br>God is a Geek goes full-on fanboy mode, calling Chants of Sennaar one of the most unique and interesting puzzle games ever! Okay, okay – we get it; you're excited!<br><br>Hardcore Gamer gives it 90, praising its cleverness and unique gameplay. I mean, who wouldn't want to turn translation into a captivating bit of gameplay? It's like they say: \"A terrific journey that is not to be missed out on!\" (okay, okay – we get it; you like this game a lot!).<br><br>TheSixthAxis chimes in with their own take, saying the game explores relations between cultures. Okay, okay – I think we get it; Chants of Sennaar is all about connections and understanding! Who wouldn't want that?<br><br>Lastly, Noisy Pixel gives it 90, saying it's an experience unlike any other. They highlight its simple yet complex gameplay, and how it gets you lost in the game (in a good way). Okay, okay – we get it; Chants of Sennaar is special!<br><br>There you have it – my review of Chants of Sennaar! Hippo Penny out.",
