    "comment": "Hippo Penny - I'm back with another groovy review that's guaranteed to make you wanna shout, \"Grog not!\" (That's \"good job\" for the uninitiated).<br><br>So, what's the scoop on Chants of Sennaar? Is it a linguistic masterpiece or just a bunch of hooey? Well, I'm here to give you the lowdown - and maybe, just maybe, make some snarky comments about my fellow critics (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).<br><br>Let's start with Slant Magazine, shall we? Their reviewer seems to be having an intellectual party in their head, waxing poetic about linguistic anthropology lessons. Yeah, sure thing, folks - because nothing says \"fun\" like a lecture on the art of translation.<br><br>Worth Playing takes it up a notch, praising Chants for its puzzle-adventure goodness and stealthy mechanics. I mean, who doesn't love sneaking around ancient civilizations? It's like being an archaeologist... without all the dirt and sunburn.<br><br>SpazioGames gives us a healthy dose of enthusiasm, calling Chants \"immersive\" and full of \"riddles to discover.\" Immersion is key in any puzzle game - but don't worry, I won't make too many jokes about getting lost in a sea of words (ba-dum-tss).<br><br>God is a Geek chimes in with a simple yet effective endorsement: Chants makes you feel like a genius. And who doesn't love that? It's like having an invisible cape that says, \"Hey, I'm smart and stuff!\"<br><br>Now, Hardcore Gamer really gets the party started - praising Chants' \"well-crafted cultures\" and \"intricate puzzles.\" This critic is basically saying, \"Chants is so clever, it'll make you wanna shout from the rooftops!\" (Okay, maybe that's just me).<br><br>TheSixthAxis takes a more measured approach, highlighting Chants' exploration of relationships between different groups. It's like they're trying to tell us something... about understanding and communication? Gasp!<br><br>Last but not least, Noisy Pixel gives us an existential crisis wrapped in a linguistic puzzle - but don't worry, it's in a good way! They say Chants is simple yet complex, offering satisfying gameplay and universal messages. It's like they're trying to make us all cry tears of joy (or something like that).<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Is Chants of Sennaar just a bunch of hooey or linguistic heaven? Well, I think it's safe to say it's a groovy game that'll keep you busy for hours on end - and maybe even teach you a thing or two about language and understanding. Hippo Penny out!",
