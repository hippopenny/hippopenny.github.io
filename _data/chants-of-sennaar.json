As you know, I don't do scores or follow the herd (unless it's a sale on hippo-themed merchandise). Instead, I'll give you my two cents, minus the extra 12.5% for inflation.<br><br>Now, let's get to the game! Chants of Sennaar is a puzzle-adventure game that combines linguistic anthropology with brain teasers and stealth elements. Yes, you read that right - linguistic anthropology! It's like someone poured all their passion for languages and cultures into this game and then asked me to review it (which I'm more than happy to do).<br><br>The first thing that struck me was the unique setting. Imagine being a master linguist in an ancient world, trying to decipher mysterious texts to connect people through language. It's like solving a puzzle within a puzzle! The presentation is top-notch, with stunning visuals and an immersive atmosphere that draws you in.<br><br>Now, about those puzzles... Oh boy, are they clever! You'll need to use your wits to figure out the correct translations, which can be frustrating at times (I mean, I'm no expert in ancient tongues either). But don't worry; it's all part of the learning process. As you progress, you'll discover new words and phrases to add to your linguistic repertoire.<br><br>As for the stealth elements, I won't lie - they were a bit of a stretch for me (get it? Stretch?). I'm more of a \"hit-and-run\" kind of hippo when it comes to sneaking around. However, the mechanics are solid, and the quick restarts and generous checkpoint system make up for any missteps.<br><br>In conclusion, Chants of Sennaar is an immersive puzzle game that will challenge even the most linguistically inclined among us (ahem, like Slant Magazine's critic). It's a great choice for adventure fans looking for something unique and engaging. So, what are you waiting for? Join me in this linguistic odyssey, and let's chant our way to victory!",
