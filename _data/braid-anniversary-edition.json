And honestly, it's still pretty great even today. But enough about me - let's talk about this review-ful review fest we've got on our hands!<br><br>So, what do all these fancy critics have to say about Braid AE? Well, God is a Geek thinks it's a reminder of how good the original was (yawn), while Metro GameCentral says it's still uniquely clever, even if some flaws haven't been ironed out (shrugs). Gaming Nexus, on the other hand, thinks this edition is near-perfect, with re-drawn art, extra levels, and commentary to boot! (Sounds like a party!)<br><br>Push Square gets all philosophical about Braid's classic status and how it still has ideas to offer, but for newcomers, the enhanced graphics and extra levels make this the definitive edition. Video Chums chimes in with \"it's both a throwback and a reminder that indie devs can rise above\" (okay, sure...). And finally, Digital Chumps gives Braid AE an essential nod, praising its updated visuals, animations, and sounds - but let's be real, they were already 100% awesome back when the original dropped!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Self-deprecating reviewer guy, why are you wasting my time with this review- fest?\" Well, my friends, it's because Braid AE is a game that needs to be talked about. It's like that one indie cousin at the gaming family reunion - you know, the one who's always trying too hard but still manages to bring some unique flair to the table.<br><br>So, what's my take on all this? Well, I think Braid AE is a fantastic way to experience one of gaming's most groundbreaking titles. Heck, even if you're new to platforming (what's wrong with you?!), there's something here for everyone! And who knows - maybe you'll even learn some game development secrets along the way!<br><br>That's it for Hippo Penny's take on Braid Anniversary Edition. Stay groovy, and remember: always keep your expectations in check (unless you're expecting 100% awesomeness, like Digital Chumps).",
