It's time to poke fun at those stuffy critics (no hard feelings, guys!) and have some real fun.<br><br>Let's start with God is a Geek, who gave this game a 90 out of 100. Ah, yes! A \"reminder\" of how good the original was – code for saying it's still a fantastic game, but not necessarily anything new or groundbreaking. I mean, who doesn't love a good reminder? It's like getting an old friend to come over and say, \"Hey, remember that one time we did this awesome thing?\"<br><br>Next up is Metro GameCentral with their 80 score. They think it's a classic indie game that remains unique, but let's be real – they're not saying anything new or earth-shattering. It's like they're just reiterating what we already know: Braid is a great game! Woohoo!<br><br>Push Square gets my attention with their 80 score as well. They think it's still worth playing for newcomers, and the enhanced graphics and extra levels make this the \"definitive edition.\" Okay, okay – I get it, guys! It's like they're trying to sell me something... or maybe it's just my inner marketing nerd talking.<br><br>But then there's PlayStation Universe with their 95 score. Oh boy, are they sappy! They say it's the best time to give Braid your attention and respect. Um, okay – I'll try to muster up some fake excitement for this game.<br><br>Video Chums comes in strong with an 80 score, saying it's both a throwback to simpler times and a reminder that indie devs can rise above. Whoa, slow down, friend! You're getting all deep and stuff!<br><br>Last but not least, we have Digital Chumps with their 100 score. They think it's an essential product for fans of Jonathan Blow (whoever that is) and a crucial reference point for anyone wanting to learn about game development. *yawn* Okay, okay – I get it, guys! You're saying this game is important... or something.<br><br>So, what does it all mean? Well, in my expert opinion (ha!), Braid: Anniversary Edition is a great game that still holds up today. But let's not get too carried away with the nostalgia and hype – it's still just a game, folks!<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
