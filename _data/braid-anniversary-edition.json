But first, a little rant about critics. You know who I'm talking about - those fancy-pants reviewers who get to play games all day and then write lengthy reviews about how deep they are. Newsflash: we're all just trying to have fun! So, without further ado, let's dive into my review of Braid Anniversary Edition.<br><br>First off, the visuals. Oh boy, do I love me some retro-style graphics. The Anniversary Edition has been given a lovely facelift, making it look like a freshly polished gem from the 8-bit era. And let's not forget the puzzles! Braid is known for its brain-twisting challenges, and this edition is no exception. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned puzzle-fest every now and then?<br><br>But what really sets Braid apart (aside from its fabulous '80s graphics) is its storytelling. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Storytelling in a puzzle game? That's not exactly the most exciting thing to hear.\" And you're right... until you start playing. See, the story behind Braid is woven into the puzzles themselves, and it's a real treat to see everything come together. It's like being part of a grand adventure, minus the awkwardly placed save points.<br><br>Now, let me just take a quick peek at what some other critics had to say...<br><br>* God is a Geek: \"Braid Anniversary Edition is a reminder of how good the original was...\" Yeah, yeah, we get it. You liked the original.<br>* Metro GameCentral: \"A classic indie game that remains as cleverly unique today as it did 16 years ago...\" Yeah, because nothing says \"clever\" like a bunch of old puzzles wrapped in new graphics.<br>* Push Square: \"Whether or not the Anniversary Edition is worth it will largely depend on your experience with the original.\" Uh-huh. Translation: if you already played Braid once and enjoyed it, go ahead and waste your money on this overpriced re-release.<br><br>And that's my two cents on Braid Anniversary Edition! It's a fantastic game for those who haven't played it before (or didn't get around to playing it back in the day), but for everyone else... well, let's just say you might want to stick with the original. Still, if you do decide to pick this up, I promise you won't be disappointed.<br><br>That's it for today! Stay groovy, and remember: always keep your pixelated priorities straight.",
