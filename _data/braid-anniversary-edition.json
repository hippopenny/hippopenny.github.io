I'm talking about Braid: Anniversary Edition. This retro classic has been given a fresh coat of paint, new levels to explore, and a dash of nostalgia. But does it still hold up in today's gaming landscape? Let me get my groovy review on!<br><br>First off, the visuals are straight fire! Those nostalgic graphics are now sharper than ever, making it a treat for both old-school fans and newcomers alike. The animations have also received an upgrade, giving the game a more fluid feel. However, some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the gameplay?\" Fear not, my friends, because Jonathan Blow's ingenious design still shines through. The puzzles are as cleverly unique as ever, challenging your problem-solving skills and rewarding you with those sweet, sweet feels.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – what about the other critics? Well, let me just say that I'm feeling like the hipster game reviewer who discovered Braid before it was cool. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea! God is a Geek gave it a 90, Metro GameCentral scored it an 80, Push Square chimed in with an 80 as well, and PlayStation Universe handed out a whopping 95. Video Chums and Digital Chumps both settled for an 80, while PlayStation LifeStyle brought home the same score.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Is Braid: Anniversary Edition worth your time? If you're new to this classic indie game, then absolutely! The enhanced graphics and extra levels make it a must-play. Even if you've played the original, there's still plenty of love and advice poured into the game's comprehensive commentary system for up-and-coming devs like yourself. However, if you've already experienced Braid before, you might not find enough new content to justify double dipping.<br><br>In conclusion, Braid: Anniversary Edition is a timeless classic that still holds up today. It's a must-play for anyone who loves puzzles, platforming, and indie game magic. So, go ahead, give it a try, and remember – don't be like me and take 10 years to review it!",
