Now, let me just put on my critic-hat (which looks suspiciously like a flower crown) and see how these big-shot reviewers did.<br><br>First off, God is a Geek gave it a 90, saying it's \"a reminder of how good the original was.\" Ah, nice try, God, but I think you might be getting your anniversary editions mixed up. This one's all about revisiting the classic indie game that started it all.<br><br>Metro GameCentral chimed in with an 80, stating Braid remains \"as cleverly unique today as it did 16 years ago.\" Yeah, no kidding! That game was like a puzzle-loving party in my brain (minus the noise complaints).<br><br>Push Square weighed in with their thoughts, giving it an 80. They said it's still got those unique ideas, but whether or not this Anniversary Edition is worth it depends on your experience with the original. I mean, who doesn't love re-experiencing the magic of Braid? (Just me, apparently.)<br><br>PlayStation Universe took things to the next level with a 95! They proclaimed it's \"the best time to give Braid your attention\" and that this upgraded edition is \"irresistible and deserving of your admiration.\" Okay, Universe, you're making me blush!<br><br>Video Chums chipped in with an 80, calling it both a throwback and a reminder of indie devs' potential. That's like saying, \"Hey, remember when Braid was cool? Yeah, it's still pretty cool!\"<br><br>Last but not least, PlayStation LifeStyle scored it a 90, saying the Anniversary Edition is all about maintaining that classic gaming magic. And honestly, who doesn't love a little bit of that?<br><br>So, what's my take on this groovy game? Well, let me just say that Braid: Anniversary Edition is a masterclass in puzzle-solving, platforming, and storytelling. It's like they took the original and said, \"Hey, remember when we used to be cool? Let's get cool again!\" Okay, maybe not exactly, but you get the idea.<br><br>All jokes aside, this game is pure bliss for those who love a good challenge and some serious brain-teasing. The Anniversary Edition might not bring new features to the table, but it's a beautiful remastering of a classic that deserves your attention.<br><br>So, grab some popcorn (or hippo food), put on your thinking cap, and get ready to experience Braid like never before!",
