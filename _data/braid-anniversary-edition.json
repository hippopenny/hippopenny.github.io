And trust me, this one is a classic. But enough about me; let's get to the reviews!<br><br>God is a Geek gives it a solid 90, saying it's a reminder of how good the original was (yawn), with stellar visuals and puzzles that are tough yet rewarding. Zzz... I mean, thanks for the sleep-inducing summary, guys.<br><br>Push Square jumps in with an 80, claiming it's still a classic that revolutionized the indie game landscape (okay, okay). They also mention that newcomers will love the enhanced graphics and extra levels, while old-timers might not find enough new content to justify double dipping. Ah, but who doesn't love a good revisit?<br><br>PlayStation Universe goes all out with a 95, declaring this the best time to give Braid your attention ( priorities, people!). They're just so excited about the clever design, puzzles, and thought-provoking tapestry that they can barely contain themselves.<br><br>Video Chums chimes in with an 80, saying it's both a throwback to simpler times and a reminder that indie devs can rise above (yep, we all needed a little reminder). They seem pretty stoked about the whole shebang.<br><br>PlayStation LifeStyle takes a more measured approach with an 80, acknowledging that this remaster is for longtime fans or those who've yet to experience it. Minor issue aside, they think this classic deserves another playthrough (or three).<br><br>Hobby Consolas gives it an 80, declaring Braid Anniversary Edition the definitive version of a game everyone should play once in their life (yikes, that's some heavy pressure). They seem pretty excited about the commentary system and new levels.<br><br>And finally, Noisy Pixel wraps things up with a 90, saying this is the perfect package for newcomers and dedicated fans alike. Who wouldn't want to revisit this classic in a new light?<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, I'm not exactly an expert (okay, I'm totally making stuff up), but I think you should totally play Braid Anniversary Edition! It's a great way to experience the timeless charm of this platformer, with all its clever puzzles and beautiful visuals.<br><br>And that's it for me today! Thanks for joining me on this wild ride through the world of video game reviews. Until next time, when I'll probably be making fun of myself again, stay groovy!",
