This game is a nostalgic trip down memory lane for many gamers, but it's also a great introduction to the world of indie gaming for newcomers.<br><br>Let's start with the good stuff - the visuals! Oh. Em. Gee. The updated graphics are stunning, making the already beautiful art style even more breathtaking. It's like looking at a work of art come to life. But, let's be real, folks, it's not just about how pretty things look (although, honestly, it's a big deal). The gameplay is still as clever and challenging as ever.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the other critics? Are they right? Do we really need an anniversary edition? Well, let me tell you, my friends. While some of these esteemed reviewers might say that this game is just a rehash of the original (looking at you, God is a Geek), I'm here to tell you that it's so much more than that.<br><br>First off, the commentary system is everything and more. It's like having a personal tutor guiding you through the puzzles, explaining the thought process behind each level design. Genius! And for up-and-coming game developers out there (hello, my fellow indie enthusiasts!), this game is a masterclass in creativity and problem-solving.<br><br>But what about new content? Well, I won't lie - it's not like Braid: Anniversary Edition is bursting with new levels or characters or anything (looking at you, Push Square). No, no. This game is all about the love and care poured into every detail by Jonathan Blow, the mastermind behind this masterpiece.<br><br>So, to all my fellow gamers out there who might be thinking of picking up Braid: Anniversary Edition, I say - go for it! It's a timeless classic that deserves your attention, regardless of whether you played it back in the day or not. Trust me, it's worth it.<br><br>That's it for this review, folks! Hippo Penny signing off with a big ol' smile on my face.",
