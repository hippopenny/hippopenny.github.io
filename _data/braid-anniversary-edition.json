Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What's so special about an anniversary edition of a game that came out in 2008?\" Well, let me tell you, this isn't just any old re-release - it's a full-on revival of a classic indie game that still holds up today.<br><br>First things first: the visuals have gotten a major upgrade. Gone are the blocky, pixelated graphics of yesteryear; instead, we've got beautiful, hand-drawn art that makes this game look like it was plucked straight from the pages of a fairy tale. And let me tell you, those animations - oh boy, they're silky smooth.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the gameplay?\" Don't worry, folks, the Anniversary Edition still packs all the same charm and challenge that made Braid a hit back in the day. You'll still be solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles, and saving princesses (or not, depending on your choice - I won't spoil it for you). And let me tell you, those extra levels? They're worth the price of admission alone.<br><br>Now, what about the other critics out there? Well, let's see...God is a Geek gave it a score of 90 and said it's \"a reminder of how good the original was, with stellar visuals and puzzles that are tough yet rewarding.\" Metro GameCentral gave it an 80, saying it's \"a classic indie game that remains as cleverly unique today as it did 16 years ago, even if none of its original flaws have been ironed out in the meantime.\" And Gaming Nexus? They went all out with a score of 95, calling it \"a near-perfect way to try out Braid, if you haven't before.\" Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the other critics? Well, let's just say that some people might find the game a bit...meh. But hey, that's what makes life interesting, right?<br><br>Anyway, in conclusion (or not - this is Hippo Penny, after all!), Braid Anniversary Edition is a must-play for anyone who loves indie games or just wants to experience something truly unique. It's got charm, it's got challenge, and it's got some of the most beautiful visuals you'll see in any game today.<br><br>So what are you waiting for? Go give it a try - your inner hippo (or outer hippo, I won't judge) will thank you!",
