I'm back with another review that's sure to make you groovy and ready to play some sick games!<br><br>Today, I'm diving into the world of indie classics with Braid: Anniversary Edition. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Braid\" is an old game, right? Well, let me tell you, it may be a vintage title, but its charm and wit still hold up today.<br><br>But before we get started, I've got to give a shoutout to my fellow critics who have already weighed in on this remastered edition. God is a Geek gave Braid: Anniversary Edition a 90, saying it's a reminder of how good the original was. Metro GameCentral also dropped an 80, calling it \"cleverly unique\" and praising its visuals.<br><br>Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get to my review! I'm thrilled to report that Braid: Anniversary Edition is just as enchanting as it was back in the day. The updated graphics are a treat for the eyes (or should I say, the groovy goggles?), and the new levels are a nice bonus.<br><br>But what really sets Braid apart is its clever puzzles and brain-teasers. These challenges will have you scratching your head one minute and grinning like a hippie the next. And let's not forget the game's signature \"rewind\" feature, which allows you to relive those triumphant moments or try again when things don't go quite right.<br><br>As with any classic, there might be some who feel that Braid: Anniversary Edition doesn't bring enough new heat to the table. But trust me, this remastered edition is a must-play for anyone looking to experience one of gaming's most groundbreaking titles.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, I'll leave that up to you, my fellow gamers. Just remember - when it comes to Braid: Anniversary Edition, the only score that really matters is the fun you have playing it!<br><br>Stay groovy, and keep on gaming!",
