I won't bother scoring this one; let's just say it's \"a game-changer\" (pun intended). So, grab your thinking caps and join me on this puzzle-solving adventure!<br><br>God is a Geek thought Braid Anniversary Edition was a reminder of how good the original was – yep, same-old, same-old, but that's what makes it timeless! Metro GameCentral agreed, stating Braid remains as cleverly unique today as it did 16 years ago... with some minor flaws ironed out. Push Square opined that, for newcomers, this edition is the definitive version, but for those who've experienced Braid before, there might not be enough new content to justify double-dipping.<br><br>PlayStation Universe gave it a glowing review: \"The best time to give Braid your attention... now!\" They're right; this anniversary edition is the perfect excuse to revisit this classic. Video Chums thought it was both a throwback and a reminder that indie devs can rise above if given the opportunity.<br><br>Now, let's get to the nitty-gritty. I won't lie – some might find Braid Anniversary Edition too similar to the original. The visual facelift is nice, but the core mechanics and gameplay remain largely unchanged. For those who were initially turned off by Braid's strict linear progression and puzzles, this remaster probably won't change their minds.<br><br>For longtime fans or newcomers looking for a timeless classic, Braid Anniversary Edition is a must-play! It may not be a sprawling open-world adventure, but it's an experience that will leave you pondering the secrets behind its development (or just enjoying those clever puzzles). Hobby Consolas summed it up best: \"The definitive version of a game everyone should play once in their life.\"<br><br>In conclusion, Braid Anniversary Edition is all about nostalgia and introducing new players to the world of this groundbreaking title. If you're looking for a fun, challenging puzzle-adventure with some visual flair, look no further!",
