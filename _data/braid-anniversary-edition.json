I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' platformer from the early 2000s? God is a Geek agrees, giving it a solid 90 out of 100. They say it's all about the visuals and puzzles being tough yet rewarding (um, yeah, because that's exactly what I want in my gaming experience - a good challenge... said no one ever). Push Square chimes in with an 80, saying that newcomers will love the enhanced graphics and extra levels, while old timers might not find enough new content to justify double dipping. And PlayStation Universe? Yeah, they're all about the classic design and cleverness of Braid's puzzles, giving it a 95.<br><br>But hey, I'm not here to just regurgitate what everyone else is saying. I'm here to bring the humor (and maybe a little bit of sass) to the table! So, what did I think of Braid: Anniversary Edition? Well, let me tell you - it's like that one aunt at the family reunion who always says the same thing every year: \"Oh, dear, have you seen the way my hair is looking today?\" You know what I mean?<br><br>In all seriousness, though, this game is a real treat. It's got those classic indie vibes, and the updated graphics don't hurt either. And if you're new to Braid (or just want an excuse to play it again), then the Anniversary Edition is definitely the way to go.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the criticisms? Ah, yeah, there are some minor issues here and there. Video Chums gives it an 80, saying that it's both a throwback to simpler times and a reminder of indie devs' potential (um, isn't that just code for \"it's old and dated\"?). And Hobby Consolas? Yeah, they think it's the definitive version, but only if you want to know the secrets behind its development (or something like that...).<br><br>So, in conclusion, Braid: Anniversary Edition is a must-play indie platformer with some minor issues. If you're new to the series or just looking for a fun game to play, then this is definitely worth checking out. And if you're one of those old timers who's been playing Braid since 2008, well... I won't judge you (much).<br><br>That's all for now, folks! See you in the next review - hopefully with some more hippo puns!",
