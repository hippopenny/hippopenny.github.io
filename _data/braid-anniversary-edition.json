    "comment": "Hippo Penny - it's time to get groovy with some Braid Anniversary Edition goodness! As a seasoned grok (see what I did there?), I'm here to give you the lowdown on this classic indie game's remastered edition.<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm no stranger to being critical (see: God is a Geek's \"90\" review). But hey, someone's gotta keep those high scores in check! That being said, Braid Anniversary Edition has won over even the most discerning critics (ahem, Push Square). So, what's the fuss all about?<br><br>For starters, this game still holds up beautifully - visually, that is. The enhanced graphics are a welcome addition, making it easy to see why some critics have likened it to looking at an old friend through new glasses (Metro GameCentral's \"80\" review comes to mind). And don't even get me started on the puzzles - they're still cleverly unique and rewarding in equal measure.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the Anniversary Edition specifically?\" Well, let me tell you, it's a great excuse to revisit this classic. For newcomers, the extra levels and commentary system make it the definitive edition (Video Chums' \"80\" review agrees). And for indie game devs looking for inspiration, the comprehensive commentary system is a treasure trove of love and advice poured into every nook and cranny.<br><br>Of course, there are some caveats. For those who have experienced Braid before, unless you're itching for a revisit (PlayStation Universe's \"95\" review suggests this might be the case), there may not be enough new content to justify double dipping. But hey, that's okay - sometimes it's just nice to re-experience something from the past in all its restored glory.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, I'll let you decide for yourself (hint: it involves a lot of groovy hand gestures). All I can say is that Braid Anniversary Edition is still a game that should be experienced by everyone at least once - and with good reason.",
