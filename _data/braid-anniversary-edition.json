Today, we're talking about Braid Anniversary Edition, a game that's been around since 2008 but still holds up like a fine wine (or a grog- aging masterpiece, if you will).<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm impressed by all these big-name critics drooling over this game. God is a Geek gave it a 90% score, saying it's a reminder of how good the original was. Metro GameCentral and Video Chums both chimed in with an 80% rating, praising its timeless appeal and clever puzzles. And PlayStation Universe? Well, they're just gushing over this anniversary edition, calling it \"irresistible\" and a \"thought-provoking tapestry\". Okay, okay, I get it – you all love Braid!<br><br>But what about me, you ask? Well, let me tell you, as someone who's not exactly a retro gaming expert (I mean, I've played some classic games in my time, but I'm no aficionado), I was excited to dive back into this indie gem. And you know what? It holds up surprisingly well! The visuals are stunning, and the puzzles are still challenging yet rewarding.<br><br>Now, I won't sugarcoat it – Braid Anniversary Edition isn't exactly a re-mastered masterpiece. If you played the original, you might find yourself thinking, \"Hey, this is just like old times!\" But if you're new to the game or looking for a fresh take, this edition delivers.<br><br>Push Square put it best: \"Whether or not the Anniversary Edition is worth it will largely depend on your experience with the original.\" For newcomers, the enhanced graphics and extra levels make this the definitive version. And for up-and-coming developers, the comprehensive commentary system is full of love and advice – what's not to like?<br><br>In conclusion, Braid Anniversary Edition is a must-play for anyone who hasn't experienced it yet (and maybe even for those who have). It's a timeless classic that still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve. So go ahead, give it a spin, and see why everyone loves this groovy game so much!<br><br>That's all for today, folks! Join me next time when I'll be reviewing some other groovy gaming goodness. Hippo Penny out!",
