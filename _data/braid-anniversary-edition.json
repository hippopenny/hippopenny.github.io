This indie classic has been re-released to celebrate its 16th anniversary (time flies!), and I'm here to give you the lowdown.<br><br>First off, let's talk about what hasn't changed - and that's a good thing! The core gameplay, puzzles, and story remain the same as the original. If you were one of the lucky ones who experienced Braid back in its prime, you'll be happy to know that this anniversary edition still retains all the cleverness and ingeniousness that made it so beloved.<br><br>Now, about what has changed... The graphics have gotten a lovely facelift, with updated visuals, animations, and sounds. It's like looking at an old friend who's had a bit of Botox - they still look familiar, but with a fresh new glow!<br><br>Some critics are raving about this remaster (check out those 100% scores from Digital Chumps!), saying it's the perfect time to experience Braid in its restored state. I agree - the Anniversary Edition is a great opportunity for newcomers to join the party and for old timers to revisit the magic.<br><br>But let's not get too caught up in the nostalgia - what about the new content, you ask? Well, there are some extra levels and puzzles to tackle, as well as a comprehensive commentary system that's perfect for up-and-coming game developers (or anyone looking for insight into how this indie masterpiece was made).<br><br>In the end, whether or not the Anniversary Edition is worth it will depend on your experience with the original. If you're a newcomer, this is the definitive edition, and if you're an old fan, well... let's just say there may be enough new content to justify double dipping (or at least, that's what I keep telling myself)!<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the world of Braid: Anniversary Edition - it's time to revisit this classic in its restored state!",
