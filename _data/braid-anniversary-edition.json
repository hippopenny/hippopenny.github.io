Okay, maybe not everyone, but that's what makes this remastered classic so special.<br><br>First off, let me just say that all these critics are totally correct when they rave about the game's visuals and puzzles being \"stellar\" (God is a Geek) and \"tough yet rewarding\" (same critic). It's like looking at an old friend who has only gotten more charming with age. The Anniversary Edition doesn't mess with the original formula, but it does give it a nice facelift to make it look all fancy and modern.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about new content?\" Well, let me tell you, Push Square's got the lowdown. For newcomers, the extra levels and enhanced graphics are a total win. And for up-and-coming game devs out there, the commentary system is like getting a masterclass in indie game development.<br><br>But what about the old timers who already played Braid back in the day? Well, unless you're just itching to replay it (no judgment here), the Anniversary Edition might not be worth another dip. That's not to say it's not still an amazing game; it's just that if you've already experienced it once, maybe the new features won't blow your mind.<br><br>PlayStation Universe gets it right when they call Braid \"groundbreaking\" and say it's the perfect time to give it your attention. And I'm like, yeah, dude! This is a timeless classic that still holds up today. It's not just for old-school gamers; it's for anyone who loves puzzles, platforming, or just wants to experience some of the best indie game development out there.<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, let me put it this way: Braid Anniversary Edition is like a warm hug from an old friend. It's familiar, comforting, and still totally awesome. If you haven't played it yet, grab the chance; if you have, well, maybe it's time to give it another spin. Hippo Penny out!",
