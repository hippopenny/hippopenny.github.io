As a seasoned (get it?) game reviewer, I'm here to give you the lowdown on this classic indie game's updated edition.<br><br>Let's start with what the critics are saying. God is a Geek gives Braid: Anniversary Edition a 90 and says it's a reminder of how good the original was, with stellar visuals and puzzles that are tough yet rewarding. Metro GameCentral agrees, giving it an 80 and stating that the game remains as cleverly unique today as it did 16 years ago. Push Square also chimes in, saying that Braid is undoubtedly a classic that revolutionized the indie game landscape, and it still has enough unique ideas to make it worth a playthrough for the first time today.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what's the deal with these fancy new graphics? Well, let me tell you, they're purty. The updated visuals are like a breath of fresh air (or should I say, a blast from the past?) that brings back all those nostalgic feels. But don't worry, it's not just about looks - the gameplay is still as challenging and engaging as ever.<br><br>Now, where's the beef? Er, I mean, where's the criticism? Well, Play Station Universe says that there may not be enough new content here to justify double dipping for old fans of the game. And Video Chums agrees, saying that it's both a throwback to simpler times and a reminder that indie devs can rise above if given the opportunity.<br><br>But hey, don't worry about that - Digital Chumps gives Braid: Anniversary Edition a perfect 100 and says it's an essential product for fans of Jonathan Blow's significant indie game. And PlayStation LifeStyle agrees, saying that the remaster is a must-play for longtime fans or those who have yet to experience this timeless classic for themselves.<br><br>So there you have it - Braid: Anniversary Edition is a groovy little number that's sure to bring back memories and make new fans alike. If you haven't played Braid before, what are you even doing with your life? Go play it! And if you have, well, go play it again! It's still a timeless classic that's worth experiencing.<br><br>And hey, if all else fails, just remember - Hippo Penny is here to bring the funny and keep things fresh.",
