Now, I know what you're thinking - what's the big deal about an old game getting a new coat of paint? Well, my friends, let me tell you - this ain't just any ol' remake. No sir! This is a masterclass in how to update a classic without ruining its essence.<br><br>First off, let's get the elephant out of the room - or rather, the critic in question. I'm talking about those fancy-pants reviewers over at God is a Geek, who gave this game a whopping 90% and said it's \"a reminder of how good the original was.\" Um, yeah, no kidding! The original Braid was (and still is) amazing, but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate the updated version too. I mean, who wouldn't want to relive those fond memories with a fresh new coat of paint? Am I right?<br><br>Now, onto the game itself - and let me tell you, it's as good as everyone says it is! The puzzles are still tricky yet rewarding (see: Metro GameCentral's 80%), the visuals are stunning (Gaming Nexus's 95% agrees), and the commentary system is a treasure trove of game dev wisdom (Digital Chumps' 100% gives it the thumbs-up). But what really sets Braid Anniversary Edition apart is its ability to be both nostalgic and modern. It's like looking at an old photo album, but instead of dusty pictures, you're seeing beautifully rendered levels with clever puzzles waiting to be solved.<br><br>Of course, there are some caveats - like whether or not the new content justifies a double dip for those who have played the original before (Push Square's 80% suggests it depends on your experience). And yeah, maybe some of the old flaws haven't been ironed out entirely (Metro GameCentral's 80%, again). But let's be real - Braid Anniversary Edition is still an essential purchase for any gamer, whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned pro. Trust me, it's worth the investment.<br><br>So there you have it, folks! That's my two cents on Braid Anniversary Edition - and I'm sticking to it like glue (or should I say, sticky notes?). Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some gaming to do...",
