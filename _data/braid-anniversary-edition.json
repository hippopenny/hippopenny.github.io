Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Grok, why are you so excited?\" Well, let me tell you, this game is a freaking masterpiece!<br><br>First off, kudos to those lovely folks at God is a Geek for giving it a 90/100 score. I mean, who wouldn't love Braid's stellar visuals and puzzles that'll keep you on your toes? Metro GameCentral agrees, giving it an 80/100 - yep, this indie game still packs a punch even after all these years! Push Square is also in on the action, praising the enhanced graphics and extra levels, making it worth playing for newcomers.<br><br>But what about the other critics? Well, let's get to it!<br><br>PlayStation Universe gives it a whopping 95/100, saying it's the best time to experience Braid's greatness. Video Chums chimes in with an 80/100, calling it both a throwback and a reminder that indie devs can shine.

Okay, okay - I know you're dying to ask: What about the other reviewers? Well, let me tell you, they all agree that Braid is a classic!<br><br>So what makes this game so special? In my humble opinion (read: not-humble), it's the way Jonathan Blow's design and puzzles weave together like a thought-provoking tapestry. It's like a beautiful puzzle box, where every piece fits perfectly - except when they don't, which is exactly when things get real interesting!<br><br>In short, Braid: Anniversary Edition is an absolute must-play for anyone who loves games that challenge you (both in-game and out-of-the-box). And if you're new to the series, well - Hippo Penny says welcome aboard! It's a wild ride filled with cleverness, ingenuity, and more than a few \"aha!\" moments.<br><br>So go ahead, give it a spin, and remember: Braid is still one of gaming's most groundbreaking titles. And if you don't believe me? Ask the critics - they're all in on this party!",
