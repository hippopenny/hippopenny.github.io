Today, I'm diving into the world of indie gaming with a revisit to the classic that started it all - Braid: Anniversary Edition. And, let me tell you, this game still has the magic!<br><br>Now, before we get into the nitty-gritty, I want to give a shoutout to my fellow critics out there (I see you, God is a Geek, Metro GameCentral, Push Square, PlayStation Universe, Video Chums, and Digital Chumps!). You guys do your thing, and I'll do mine - which, of course, involves poking fun at myself and making witty remarks. <br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, for starters, Braid: Anniversary Edition is a masterclass in game design. Jonathan Blow's brainchild is still a puzzle-lover's dream come true, with cleverly crafted levels that will keep you hooked from start to finish. And let me tell you, those visuals have gotten an upgrade - it's like looking at the original, but with a fresh coat of paint!<br><br>But here's the thing: this remaster isn't just about giving the old game a shiny new face. No way! It's also about preserving that magic for newbies (and old-timers) to experience and enjoy. And trust me, it still holds up - even if some critics might say it's \"strictly linear progression\" or whatever (more on that later).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: is this review just going to be a regurgitation of what everyone else has said? NO WAY, Jos√©! This is where I get to bring my own unique spin to the table. And let me tell you, it's time for some self-deprecation.<br><br>Honestly, I was expecting more...I don't know, maybe some new levels or something? But nope, it's still the same old Braid we all know and love (and occasionally hate). And you know what? That's perfectly fine. Because at its core, Braid is a timeless classic that will always be worth playing - even if it doesn't change much from the original.<br><br>In conclusion, if you haven't played Braid before, now's the time to give it a shot (and this Anniversary Edition is the perfect excuse). And if you have, well...it's still an amazing game that deserves another playthrough. So go ahead, grab some popcorn, and get ready for a puzzle-adventure like no other!<br><br>That's it for today, folks! Tune in next time for more wacky reviews from this self-proclaimed seasonal grok critic.",
