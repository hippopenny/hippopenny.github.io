As I dove back into this timeless classic, I couldn't help but notice that most critics are still singing its praises like a bunch of excited indie folk.<br><br>God is a Geek gives it a solid 90, praising the \"stellar visuals\" and \"tough yet rewarding\" puzzles. Metro GameCentral agrees, giving it an 80 and calling it a \"classic indie game\" that remains \"cleverly unique\" to this day. Push Square chimes in with an 80 as well, noting that newcomers will love the enhanced graphics and extra levels, while veteran players might not find enough new content to justify another playthrough.<br><br>But what about yours truly? Well, let's just say I'm a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to remasters. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the effort, but sometimes I feel like they're just trying to cash in on nostalgia rather than bringing anything new to the table.<br><br>PlayStation Universe gives Braid: Anniversary Edition a glowing 95, calling it \"the best time\" to experience this classic in its restored state. Video Chums agrees, giving it an 80 and saying it's both a throwback to simpler times and a reminder that indie devs can rise above if given the opportunity.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the criticisms? Well, PlayStation LifeStyle gives it an 90 but notes that some folks might be turned off by the game's linear progression and uncompromising puzzles. Hobby Consolas agrees, giving it an 80 and saying that while it's the definitive version of a game everyone should play once, it's not exactly bursting with new features.<br><br>All in all, Braid Anniversary Edition seems to be getting a warm reception from critics and players alike. And you know what? I'm right there with them. This game still holds up today, and if you haven't played it before (or at least revisited it), now is the perfect time to give it a go.<br><br>So what are you waiting for? Get ready to relive some indie gaming magic!",
