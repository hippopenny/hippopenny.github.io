Now, I know what you're thinking... another critic-filled review? Fear not, young gamers! This one's gonna be fun, and we'll get to the juicy stuff in no time.<br><br>First off, let me just say that Braid has aged like a fine wine. It's still as cleverly unique today as it was back in 2008, and those clever folks at Number None (Jonathan Blow's studio) have done an amazing job of updating the visuals, animations, and sounds to make this Anniversary Edition truly shine.<br><br>Now, I know some critics out there might say that not much has changed, but I think that's where they're wrong. Sure, the core package hasn't drastically altered, but that's what makes Braid so timeless - it remains a classic indie game that still holds up today.<br><br>God is a Geek gave it a solid 90, praising the \"stellar visuals\" and \"puzzles that are tough yet rewarding.\" Metro GameCentral echoed those sentiments, saying it remains a \"cleverly unique\" game with \"none of its original flaws having been ironed out in the meantime.\"<br><br>Push Square took things a step further, calling Braid a \"classic that revolutionized the indie game landscape,\" and praising the enhanced graphics and extra levels. They even gave props to the comprehensive commentary system - yikes, I'm getting excited just thinking about it!<br><br>PlayStation Universe gave it a whopping 95, saying it's the \"best time to give Braid your attention\" and praising its design, puzzles, and interconnected elements that weave a thought-provoking tapestry. Who wouldn't want that in their gaming experience?<br><br>Video Chums chimed in, calling Braid both a throwback to simpler times and a reminder that indie devs can rise above if given the opportunity.<br><br>And Digital Chumps? They gave it a perfect 100, saying it's an essential product for fans of Jonathan Blow's significant indie game (ahem, me).<br><br>PlayStation LifeStyle had some reservations about how little the core package has changed, but ultimately praised the visual facelift and gameplay that remains as timeless as ever.<br><br>So what's the takeaway from all these critics? Braid: Anniversary Edition is a must-play for anyone who loves classic indie games or wants to experience one of gaming's most groundbreaking titles. Heck, I'd even recommend it to new gamers looking for a taste of what the early days of indie gaming were all about!<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny and I give Braid: Anniversary Edition two enthusiastic thumbs up (and that's not counting my other four hands)! It's a true gaming classic that will continue to delight and challenge players for generations to come.<br><br>Stay groovy, gamers!",
