But hey, that's what makes gaming fun, right?<br><br>Let's start with the positives (because I need some positivity in my life). Meristation gives it a 90, saying it's \"a great remake\" that respects the original while expanding on its good parts. GameStar agrees, praising the developers for preserving the spirit of the game with some meaningful additions. These guys get it - they know how to bring out the best in a classic (as long as that classic is 20 years old, but let's not count the days).<br><br>Play! Zine takes a more nuanced approach, saying it's \"a remake of mixed flavors\" - a great phrase that perfectly captures my feelings about most TV shows. Some parts are awesome, some parts suck, and you're just trying to find your way through it all while muttering 'but it could be better' in the background.<br><br>Gamingbible is another fan who says this remake \"captures the spirit of the game\" while making it feel new again - much like how my jokes might capture the essence of mediocrity. And hey, if you're a fan of the original Mafia game, then you should give this remake a try; just don't expect me to join you on that crazy rollercoaster ride they call an open world.<br><br>Carole Quintaine loves the visuals and some minor additions (especially regarding driving), but notes that there are technical issues lurking beneath the surface - much like how I always notice a bad joke even when no one else sees it. Quality writing, mafia atmosphere? Maybe for you.<br><br>The main critics who put me to sleep with boredom have got to be CD-Action and 4Players.de (not naming names). They both give the remake mixed reviews without any major redeeming qualities (besides \"it stays true to the original\" - that'll do, I guess).<br><br>All in all, it's another mixed bag for Mafia: Definitive Edition. But honestly? That review was all about me poking fun at other critics and not really saying much. You know what they say: if you can't make fun of someone else's opinions, then maybe I should just go back to playing games all day!",
