    "comment": "Disco Elysium The Final Cut is a work of genius, wrapped in a chaotic, existentialist detective mystery with a splash of dark humor. This definitive edition takes the already phenomenal RPG to new heights, offering an experience that is both thought-provoking and utterly engaging. The added quests and well-voiced characters further elevate the game, leaving you yearning to immerse yourself in its intricate world. Sure, there may be some technical hiccups, but they're a small price to pay for the sheer brilliance of Disco Elysium. Dive into its world and let yourself be captivated by its depth and complexity. Get ready to become a superstar detective in this highly detailed RPG. Now excuse me while I go shoot finger guns at Kim Kitsuragi for the hundredth time!",
