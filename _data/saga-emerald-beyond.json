I mean, aside from those critics who don't get it (more on that later). <br><br>Let me tell you, this game is like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while eating a bowl of alphabet soup. It's quirky, weird, and sometimes downright confusing, but in the best possible way! The combat system? Addictive as heck! You'll find yourself grinding for hours because \"just one more battle won't hurt\"... until you realize it's 3 AM and your cat has been staring at you for 30 minutes.<br><br>Now, about those critics. Worth Playing calls SaGa: Emerald Beyond a love-it-or-hate-it game, and honestly? I think that's the kindest way to put it. For those not familiar with the series (I'm looking at you, RPG Fan), this might be a bit of a mixed bag. The storytelling and exploration mechanics are... interesting. Imagine trying to find your way through a Tokyo subway station during rush hour while being chased by a group of mischievous raccoons. Yeah, it's that kind of confusing.<br><br>But hey, what do I know? Even the great critics like RPG Site and Shacknews have their own opinions. For example, RPG Site thinks SaGa Emerald Beyond is \"a tough ask for the average RPG fan,\" while Shacknews calls it a game that \"wants you to tinker and fail.\" Yeah, no kidding! That's what makes SaGa games so... well, SaGa-like.<br><br>PSX Brasil sums it up nicely: \"SaGa Emerald Beyond is another good step for the series, evolving the ideas seen in its predecessor and delivering a fun RPG based on freedom and challenge.\" And I couldn't agree more. It's not perfect, but this game has heart (or should I say, it has a quirky Japanese sense of humor?).<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a SaGa game that's willing to take risks and challenge your expectations, then SaGa: Emerald Beyond is the game for you! Just be prepared to have your head scratched by the weirdness. And hey, who knows? You might just find yourself enjoying every minute of it!",
