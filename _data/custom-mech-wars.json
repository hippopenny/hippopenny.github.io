    "comment": "Custom Mech Wars is a mixed bag of mech mayhem. While the customization options and mech-building system are a blast, the overall gameplay falls short in delivering a compelling experience. The single-player campaign feels lackluster, and the multiplayer options are limited. If you're a die-hard mech enthusiast, you might find some enjoyment in tinkering with the mechs, but for the average player, there are better options out there. With repetitive mission design and uninspiring combat, Custom Mech Wars struggles to capitalize on its promising concept.",
