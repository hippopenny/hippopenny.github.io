    "comment": "Custom Mech Wars offers an extensive mech construction system, but falls short in delivering an exciting and engaging gameplay experience. The game's campaign and multiplayer modes lack depth and fail to provide sustained enjoyment. While the mech creation aspect may initially entertain players, it quickly becomes repetitive without meaningful avenues for sharing and exploring custom designs. Custom Mech Wars struggles to capture the essence of thrilling mech combat, resulting in a mediocre gaming experience.",
