Before I start, let me just say that my expertise in this area is limited to playing plenty of Age of Empires on my GameCube (don't judge me). But hey, that's what makes my review so... unique?<br><br>Now, onto the good stuff! Men of War II has received a mixed bag of scores from critics, ranging from 65 to 80. SpazioGames gave it a 77, praising its deep gameplay but criticizing the UI and lack of guidance for new players. COGconnected handed out an 78, saying that while it's approachable, there's still a lot to master, and fans of the original will enjoy it.<br><br>PC Gamer's score was a bit lower at 74, calling it a \"flawed but rewarding gem\" for masochistic RTS fans (umm... thanks?). GameSpew gave it a 70, noting that it takes work to get started, but its realism, depth, and freedom to explore strategies make it a winner.<br><br>IGN Italia was more enthusiastic with an 80, praising the game's depth and unique experience. CGMagazine, on the other hand, was not impressed, giving it a 65 and saying it stuck too closely to its nostalgic roots (yawn). Shacknews rounded out the scores with an 80, commending its fresh take on the genre.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, I've got my own set of opinions (read: biases), but as a self-proclaimed casual RTS player (okay, I just like blowing stuff up), I think Men of War II is... fun! The game has a lot going for it, from its realistic WWII setting to the complexity of its combat systems. However, I do agree with some critics that the UI could use some work, and getting started might feel overwhelming.<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a deep RTS experience with plenty of depth (heh), Men of War II might be the game for you! Just don't expect me to give you a strategy guide or anything...",
