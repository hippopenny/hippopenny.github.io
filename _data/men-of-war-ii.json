But don't worry, I'm here to break it down in a way that's easy to understand, even for those who are new to the RTS scene.<br><br>Let's start with the good stuff. SpazioGames gives Men of War II 77 points for being \"a RTS game with an incredible deep gameplay\" despite some UI hiccups and lack of hand-holding. Yeah, it might take some time to get the hang of things, but if you're willing to put in the effort, this game is all about offering a rich and rewarding experience.<br><br>COGconnected agrees that Men of War 2 has depth and complexity, but also notes that it takes a lot of time to master. Fans of the original will love it, while casual RPG players might find it overwhelming at first. But hey, when you're playing with or against other humans online, this game really shines.<br><br>Now, about those UI issues... 3DJuegos gives Men of War II a thumbs up despite some delays, saying that it's a great sequel for RTS fans who enjoy a challenge. And PC Gamer agrees that it's flawed but still rewarding, perfect for masochistic RTS enthusiasts like yours truly.<br><br>On the other hand, Cubed3 finds Men of War II to be solid but with clunky controls and complicated gameplay. The always-online requirement isn't its strongest feature either. But hey, if you're willing to put in the work, this game has a lot of potential.<br><br>GameSpew takes it one step further by saying that Men of War II is a winner despite some frustrating details. And IGN Italia agrees that it's an astoundingly deep real-time strategy game with unique experiences in world war 2 simulation.<br><br>So there you have it - my take on Men of War II, straight from the horse's mouth (or rather, my groovy gaming self). If you're up for a challenge and don't mind putting in some effort to master the game, this one might just be worth your while. Hippo out!",
