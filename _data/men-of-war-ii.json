I'm not one of those serious critics who take themselves too seriously, but rather a fun-loving reviewer who likes to poke fun at myself and others while still giving you the lowdown on this game.<br><br>First off, let me just say that Men of War II is a lot to take in. It's like trying to drink from a firehose, except instead of water, it's complexity and depth. But hey, if you're into that sorta thing, then this game might be right up your alley! <br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the always-online requirement?\" Well, let me tell you, it's a bit of a sore spot for some folks. But honestly, I think it's just a minor quibble in an otherwise awesome game. And hey, if you're worried about it, just remember that you can always play offline and pretend like you're actually on the battlefield... minus the whole \"getting blown up\" part.<br><br>As for the other critics out there, well, let me just say that they seem to agree that Men of War II is a bit of a challenge. SpazioGames calls it \"incredible deep gameplay,\" while COGconnected says it's \"rewarding to master.\" Even PC Gamer admits that it's \"flawed but rewarding gem\" for masochistic RTS fans. And IGN Italia? They think it's an \"astoundingly deep real-time strategy game that offers a unique experience in world war 2 simulation.\"<br><br>Of course, not everyone is quite so impressed. Cubed3 says the game has \"clunky controls and complicated gameplay,\" while GameSpew notes that it can be frustrating at times. But hey, that's just part of the fun, right? <br><br>In any case, I hope this review has been helpful in giving you a sense of what Men of War II is all about. It's not for everyone, but if you're into RTS games and don't mind a challenge, then this might be the game for you!",
