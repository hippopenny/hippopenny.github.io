As a seasonal grok video game reviewer (try saying that three times fast), I've had my fair share of RTS games, but this one's different. Like, it's really different. You know when you're trying to get your cat to do tricks for treats? Yeah, it's like that, but with tanks and soldiers instead.<br><br>Now, I'm not going to lie; the learning curve is steep. It's like trying to climb a never-ending staircase of complexity while being attacked by waves of German soldiers (not that I'm bitter or anything). But hey, that's what makes Men of War II so rewarding when you finally get the hang of it!<br><br>As the critics would say:<br><br>* SpazioGames gives it a 77: \"Incredible deep gameplay\"...yeah, about that...it's not exactly intuitive. <br>* COGconnected scores it an 78: \"Fans of the original will find it to be a worthy sequel\"...agreed!<br>* PC Gamer gives it a 74: \"Flawed but rewarding gem for masochistic RTS fans\"...uh-huh!<br>* GameSpew scores it a 70: \"Realism, depth and freedom to explore your own strategies still make it a winner\"...yeah, about that realism...I mean...<br>* IGN Italia awards it an 80: \"An astoundingly deep real time strategy game that offers a unique experience in world war 2 simulation\"...wow, they really liked it!<br>* CGMagazine gives it a 65: \"Men of War II stuck to its nostalgic roots too closely, failing to bring anything new\\u2014other than cleaning up its clunky interface from previous games\"...ouch, harsh words!<br>* Shacknews scores it an 80: \"Fresh and ambitious take on a genre that's usually comfortable staying the same\"...yup!<br><br>Now, I'm not saying Men of War II is perfect (although, let me tell you, those Germans can be quite...persistent). However, if you're willing to put in the time and effort, you'll be rewarded with some serious strategic satisfaction. Plus, the multiplayer mode is a blast! Er, pun intended.<br><br>In conclusion, Men of War II is a WWII RTS that's all about depth, complexity, and occasionally frustration (just like my cat when I take away her treats). If you're up for the challenge, it's definitely worth checking out!<br><br>That's it for this grok-umentary review!",
