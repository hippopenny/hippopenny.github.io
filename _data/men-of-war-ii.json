Well, not everyone, but definitely the critics who actually bothered to play it. I mean, come on, SpazioGames, you scored it 77 and barely mentioned anything good about it? What's going on here?<br><br>Moving on, COGconnected gives Men of War II a solid score and praise for its depth and complexity. Yeah, because nothing says \"fun\" like getting overwhelmed by too many systems and mechanics. I mean, who doesn't love a good challenge... right before they uninstall the game in frustration? <br><br>Now, 3DJuegos has given it [Recommended], despite the delays. I'm not sure what's more impressive, the fact that they managed to play the game or the fact that Best Way didn't hold their hand throughout the entire experience.<br><br>PC Gamer has called it a \"flawed but rewarding gem.\" Oh boy, that sounds like a thrilling recommendation! Who doesn't love playing a broken game? It's like having a relationship where your partner is just okay with being in an abusive situation. <br><br>Cubed3 says it's solid but marred by clunky controls and complicated gameplay. You know what they say: \"solid\" is just code for \"this game is fine, I guess.\" And don't even get me started on the always-online requirement. What's next? Are we going to need a constant internet connection to breathe?<br><br>GameSpew has given it a 70, praising its realism and freedom to explore strategies. Realism is all well and good, but let's be real (pun intended), who really wants to play a game that's trying to simulate World War II in every way possible? It's like watching a documentary... while trying to save the world from Nazi zombies. <br><br>And finally, IGN Italia has given it an 80 for being an \"astoundingly deep\" real-time strategy game. Who wouldn't want to spend hours learning complex systems and mechanics? Sounds like a blast!<br><br>In all seriousness, Men of War II seems like a game that's got its fans and haters in equal measure. If you're into RTS games and are looking for something with depth and complexity, then this might be the game for you. Just don't forget to pack your patience (and a dictionary) when playing it.<br><br>And that's it for today, folks! Stay groovy, and remember: Hippo Penny is always here to bring the humor and help you make up your own mind about what games are worth playing.",
