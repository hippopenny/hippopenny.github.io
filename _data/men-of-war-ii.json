It's time to get our groove on and review Men of War II!<br><br>As I dive into this World War II real-time strategy game, I'm reminded of SpazioGames' words: \"Men of War II is a RTS game with an incredible deep gameplay...\" Yeah, that's about right! But don't worry; I won't make you feel like you need a Ph.D. in gaming to enjoy it (although COGconnected does mention that fans of the original will find it a worthy sequel). Nope, this review is for anyone looking for a good ol' fashioned RTS experience!<br><br>Now, let's get to the nitty-gritty! The UI might be a bit wonky at times (PC Gamer calls it \"flawed but rewarding\"), and some controls can be clunky (Cubed3 agrees). But hey, who doesn't love a challenge? And did you know that 3DJuegos thinks Men of War II is one of the best RTS games out there? Yaaas, I'm feeling the hype!<br><br>GameSpew says it takes a little work to get into, but once you do, it's all about exploring your own strategies and having fun! And don't even get me started on IGN Italia â€“ they're absolutely blown away by this game! (I mean, who wouldn't be with those graphics and realism?)<br><br>All in all, Men of War II is a solid RTS that'll keep you busy for hours on end. So grab some popcorn, put on your thinking cap, and get ready to take the battlefield by storm!<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
