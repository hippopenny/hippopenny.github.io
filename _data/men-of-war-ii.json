We're diving into Men of War II, a real-time strategy game that's got some serious depth and complexity. But before we do, let me just say that I'm feeling like a hippo in a bathtub - relaxed, yet ready to dive deep.<br><br>Now, let's take a look at what the other critics had to say:<br><br>* SpazioGames thought it was a \"RTS game with an incredible deep gameplay\" (77/100). Yeah, okay, no surprises here. They loved the depth.<br>* COGconnected said Men of War 2 is \"warranted sequel\" for fans of the original, but might be overwhelming for casual players (78/100). I agree - this game isn't for the faint of heart!<br>* PC Gamer dubbed it a \"flawed but rewarding gem\" for masochistic RTS fans (74/100). Yep, they're just as crazy as we are.<br>* Cubed3 thought it was solid, but marred by clunky controls and complicated gameplay - plus that annoying always-online requirement (60/100). Uh-oh, sounds like someone's got some 'splainin' to do.<br>* GameSpew liked the realism, depth, and freedom to explore strategies, but wasn't too thrilled about the online requirement (70/100). I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned internet connection?<br>* IGN Italia gave it an impressive 80/100, praising its astoundingly deep gameplay. Yeah, that's more like it!<br>* CGMagazine thought Men of War II was stuck in its ways, failing to bring anything new (65/100). Aw, come on - a little innovation never hurt anyone!<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, let me put it this way: I'm not a morning hippo - I take my time getting into the game. But once I'm there, I'm all in! The depth and complexity of Men of War II are absolutely fascinating. It's like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while juggling chainsaws (don't ask me how I know this).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Penny, why should I care about some RTS game with complicated controls?\" Well, my curious companions, it's because Men of War II is not just any old strategy game. It's a time capsule from World War II that'll transport you back to the trenches and make you feel like you're part of the action. And let's be real - who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned war game?<br><br>In conclusion, Men of War II is an amazing RTS game that's sure to satisfy even the most discerning gamers out there (see what I did there?). So grab your rifle, put on your best \"I'm-a-War-Guru\" face, and dive into the world of real-time strategy - but don't say I didn't warn you about those clunky controls.",
