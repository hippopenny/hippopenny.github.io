But before we dive in, let me just say that I'm not SpazioGames - I don't have 77 years' worth of experience in the field (of battle, duh!). Heck, I barely survived my first encounter with a video game review (RIP, my gaming skills).<br><br>Now, onto Men of War II! This real-time strategy game has it all: historical accuracy, depth, and freedom to explore your own strategies. But don't get me wrong - it's not for the faint of heart. COGconnected said as much, warning casual RPG players that they might feel a little overwhelmed at first. And I'm like, \"Yeah, yeah, you think this is tough? Wait till you try playing it while simultaneously solving world hunger and baking a cake from scratch!\"<br><br>But in all seriousness, Men of War II does seem to have some growing pains. Cubed3 pointed out the clunky controls and complicated gameplay, which might leave new players feeling like they're trying to navigate a minefield (minus the fun and excitement). And 3DJuegos mentioned that it's not for everyone, but hey, if you enjoy an RTS set in WWII, this is definitely worth checking out.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the always-online requirement?\" Well, GameSpew wasn't too fond of that either, but hey, at least they acknowledge that Men of War II's realism, depth, and freedom to explore your own strategies make it a winner. And IGN Italia seems to agree, saying that this game is an astoundingly deep RTS that offers a unique experience in world war 2 simulation.<br><br>And there you have it - my take on Men of War II! It's not perfect, but hey, what is? At least it's honest with you about how much time and effort you'll need to put in. So if you're up for the challenge, grab your gear (or rather, your mouse) and get ready to rumble!<br><br>(P.S. If you need me, I'll be over here, trying to tame this beastly RTS game...)",
