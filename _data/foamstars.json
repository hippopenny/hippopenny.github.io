    "comment": "Foamstars is like a bubble bath of conflicting emotions. Its engaging combat and colorful party atmosphere draw you in, but the flat single-player content and aggressive monetization burst the fun bubble. The slow update plan and time-gated queues leave you feeling deflated, despite the potential for bubbly fun. Worth a dip, but watch out for the foam parties.",
