There's something about the challenge, the strategy, and the sense of accomplishment when you finally defeat that pesky dragon (or in this case, giant spider) that just gets me pumped.<br><br>Enter Legend of Grimrock, a charming dungeon crawler that's equal parts nostalgic nod to the classics and clever modernization. It's like stumbling upon a dusty old vinyl record store, only instead of flipping through albums, you're exploring ancient ruins and battling fearsome beasts.<br><br>The critics are raving (I mean, I'm not biased at all), with Destructoid giving it a 95 and praising its \"wonderfully crafted\" level design, enemy placement, and puzzles. GameSpy is also on board, calling it a \"terrific experience\" that's \"hard-pressed to find a modern game like Legend of Grimrock anytime soon.\" Computer Games Online RO agrees, saying it's a great reminder of why the genre was so popular in its heyday.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the DarkStation review?\" Ah, yes. Those folks over at DarkStation are all about that calculated playstyle, praising Legend of Grimrock for rewarding players who take their time to explore and learn. And Gamereactor Denmark is also on board, saying it's a \"welcome return to a long lost time in game history.\"<br><br>Of course, not everyone is singing along. Polygon gives it a more lukewarm 65, citing some puzzles that feel more like random button-mashing exercises than actual challenges.<br><br>All in all, Legend of Grimrock is a delightful romp through the good old days of RPGs. It's a great game for players who love a good puzzle or just want to experience some classic dungeon crawling action. So grab your backpack, sharpen your sword, and get ready to explore the ancient ruins of... well, you know what I mean!",
