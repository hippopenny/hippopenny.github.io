It's like someone took a bunch of different survival games (RimWorld, The Sims, etc.) and mashed them all together into one big, beautiful mess.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What makes this game so special?\" Well, let me tell you, it's not the fact that it looks exactly like RimWorld with a slightly different art style. No, no, no. It's the way the developers at Haemimont Games have taken those borrowed elements and twisted them into something new and unique.<br><br>The game is all about building a colony on a foreign planet, making sure your people are happy and healthy, and trying not to die from boredom or radiation poisoning. And let me tell you, it's a real challenge. One minute you're relaxing in the shade of a tree, the next you're scrambling for oxygen as a toxic gas cloud rolls in.<br><br>But what really sets Stranded apart is the choices you make throughout the game. Do you spend your resources building a shelter or trying to find more food? Do you risk sending out an expedition party to gather supplies or do you play it safe and stay close to home? The impact of those choices is real, folks. I've seen colonies thrive under my care, only to be destroyed by natural disasters or hostile alien attacks.<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna lie - some critics have given this game a little flack for lacking options in crafting, character generation, and random events (GameStar, I'm looking at you). And yeah, maybe it could use a few more scenarios to keep things fresh. But hey, what's here is already pretty great, if you ask me.<br><br>And speaking of critics, let's take a peek at what some of them have had to say:<br><br>* GamingTrend gave Stranded an 88 and said it's \"a well-focused survival game with choices that have meaningful and lasting impact.\"<br>* God is a Geek scored it an 85 and called it \"a delightful 3D variant of RimWorld with some fresh ideas, but it needs more variety in combat and everyday life.\"<br>* PC Gamer gave it an 86 and said it's \"a survival colony builder that generates stories of triumph, disaster, and white-knuckle rescues.\"<br><br>And so on.<br><br>In conclusion, Stranded: Alien Dawn is a wild ride that will keep you busy for hours on end. Sure, it may not have everything (although the Steam Workshop mods are looking like a lot of fun). But what's here is already pretty great, if you ask me. So grab some space rations and get ready to explore this crazy alien planet!",
