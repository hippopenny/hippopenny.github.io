And by \"everyone,\" I mean me, and probably some other critics out there (hello, fellow reviewers!).<br><br>So, what makes this game so special? Well, for starters, it's got a great mix of The Sims' building-and-nurturing vibe and RimWorld's (get ready for it) stranded-on-a-foreign-planet-with-no-phones-or- Wi-Fi survival vibes. That sounds weird, I know, but trust me, it works.<br><br>Now, let's get to what the critics are saying:<br><br>* GamingTrend gives it 88/100, praising its focus and meaningful choices.<br>* God is a Geek gives it 85/100, loving how Stranded: Alien Dawn \"meshes\" borrowed elements into something new and exciting.<br>* PC Gamer gives it 86/100, saying it's a survival colony builder that generates stories of triumph, disaster, and white-knuckle rescues (sign me up for that kind of stress!).<br>* GameStar gives it 79/100, calling it a \"delightful 3D variant\" with fresh ideas, but needing more variety in combat and everyday life.<br>* CGMagazine gives it 80/100, saying it's great for newcomers to the Survival/Strategy genre, even if hardcore fans might find some features lacking.<br>* PC Games gives it 80/100, calling it a \"great mix\" between The Sims and RimWorld (yep, I'm a fan of that mix too!).<br>* TheGamer gives it 70/100, saying it's already a good game but needs more customization, narrative elements, scenarios, and expansion to become a great game.<br><br>So, what do we get when we combine all these positive reviews? A survival colony builder that's got something for everyone! Whether you're a fan of building settlements or fighting off alien threats (or both!), Stranded: Alien Dawn is the perfect place to start your intergalactic adventure.<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
