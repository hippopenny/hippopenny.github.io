It's your favorite seasonal grok video game reviewer here to spill the beans on Haemimont Games' latest survival gem, Stranded: Alien Dawn!<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm not exactly the target audience for this game. I mean, who is? Right? You know, people who enjoy building a new civilization on a foreign planet and making sure their colonists don't die from radiation poisoning? Yeah, that's not my thing. Or is it?<br><br>In all seriousness, Stranded: Alien Dawn has been getting a lot of love from critics (and I'm not just saying that because they're my friends). GamingTrend gave it an 88%, God is a Geek scored it an 85%, and PC Gamer didn't think too highly of the combat (86%). GameStar, on the other hand, thought it was a delightful 3D variant of RimWorld (79%), while CGMagazine and PC Games both gave it a solid 80%. And then there's TheGamer, who thought it was already a good game but had room for improvement (70%).<br><br>Now, I'm not going to sugarcoat things – some critics did have some issues with the lack of options in crafting, character generation, and random events. But hey, that's what mods are for, right? Beyond Stranded is already bringing new life to this game, adding all sorts of traits, survivors, and expeditions.<br><br>So, what does Hippo Penny think? Well, I'm a grok reviewer, not some fancy-schmancy critic with a Ph.D. in Game Development 101. But honestly, I had a blast playing Stranded: Alien Dawn. It's like The Sims meets RimWorld (you know, the ones that get all the cool kids excited). You build your own little alien colony, manage resources, and try not to kill off your colonists with radiation poisoning. Easy peasy!<br><br>Of course, it's not without its flaws – I mean, where do I even start? But hey, who doesn't love a good challenge? And trust me when I say that this game is all about choice and consequence. You make decisions, and they actually matter.<br><br>So, if you're in the mood for some intergalactic survival action, give Stranded: Alien Dawn a try! Just don't expect me to join you – I'll be over here, reviewing games... or not.",
