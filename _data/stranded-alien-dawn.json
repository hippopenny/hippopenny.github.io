Welcome to my review of the out-of-this-world survival game, Stranded: Alien Dawn!<br><br>As I delved into this intergalactic colony builder, I couldn't help but think: what would happen if the developers of RimWorld and The Sims got together, had a baby (or maybe even a few), and then sent it to Mars? Well, Stranded: Alien Dawn is that baby – and it's a cutie!<br><br>Let's start with the gameplay. You play as a survivor stranded on an alien planet, where you must build a new home, gather resources, and fend off hostile creatures. Sounds familiar? Yes, it does borrow from RimWorld and The Sims, but Haemimont Games has woven these elements together so seamlessly that it feels fresh and exciting.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the lack of options in crafting, character generation, and random events?\" Ah, my friends, those are just minor quibbles. Trust me, as you delve deeper into this game, you'll find plenty to keep you busy – for dozens of hours, even on your first playthrough! And that's just scratching the surface (or should I say, the Martian soil?).<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without a dash of criticism (and a wink to my fellow critics). GamingTrend gives Stranded: Alien Dawn an impressive 88, praising its well-focused survival gameplay and meaningful choices. Meanwhile, God is a Geek awards it 85, citing its unique blend of borrowed elements. And PC Gamer? They're all about the stories of triumph, disaster, and white-knuckle rescues (86, anyone?). <br><br>Now, I know some of my colleagues might be a bit more... critical. GameStar gives Stranded: Alien Dawn a 79, lamenting its lack of variety in combat and everyday life. And CGMagazine? They're all about the experience for new players to the Survival/Strategy genre (80). PC Games, on the other hand, raves about the game's long-term satisfying campaigns (80).<br><br>And then there's TheGamer – who, let's be real, is a bit of a party pooper. They give Stranded: Alien Dawn a 70, saying it needs more customization and narrative elements... but hey, at least they acknowledge its potential for modding greatness!<br><br>In the end, Stranded: Alien Dawn is a delightful 3D variant of RimWorld with some fresh ideas. It might not be perfect, but it's certainly an entertaining ride to the red planet and back again. So, if you're ready to join me on this intergalactic adventure – or just want to give those space- colonizers a try – grab your spacesuit and let's get stranded!<br><br>That's all for now, folks! Stay groovy, and remember: always keep your oxygen tank full (just kidding... sort of).",
