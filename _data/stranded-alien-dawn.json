This survival game from Haemimont Games has got me hooked on building a new civilization on a foreign planet (because who wouldn't want to escape Earth's chaos and start anew?). With its unique blend of RimWorld and The Sims, Stranded: Alien Dawn is all about making tough choices that impact your colony's fate.<br><br>Now, let's get real for a sec – I'm not exactly the most seasoned critic (get it? Seasoned? Okay, moving on...). But hey, that's what makes this review so much fun! I'm gonna poke fun at my fellow critics, and you know what? They're gonna get it.<br><br>GamingTrend says Stranded: Alien Dawn is a \"well-focused survival game with meaningful and lasting impact.\" Yeah, yeah, we've all heard that before – but trust me, this one delivers. You'll be busy for dozens of hours, and that's just your first playthrough! (Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you're playing the same level repeatedly).<br><br>God is a Geek thinks Stranded: Alien Dawn \"borrows from RimWorld and The Sims\" – yep, it does, but hey, who doesn't love borrowing ideas? It's all about how you mash them together into something unique (and immensely rewarding). I mean, have you ever tried to make a pizza by combining two completely different recipes? Sounds crazy, right? But that's what makes Stranded: Alien Dawn so darn tasty!<br><br>PC Gamer calls it \"a survival colony builder that generates stories of triumph, disaster, and white-knuckle rescues.\" Yep, that about sums it up – except for the whole 'white-knuckle' part. I mean, I'm not exactly a fan of roller coasters or skydiving (or basically anything that involves my stomach dropping), but hey, if you're into that sorta thing...<br><br>Now, let's get to those less-than-stellar scores. GameStar says it needs \"more variety in combat and everyday life.\" Ouch, harsh criticism, bro! Don't worry; I won't tell anyone your secret love for pixelated combat.<br><br>And then there's TheGamer, who thinks the game needs more customization, narrative elements, scenarios, and general expansion. Okay, okay, we get it – you want more! But hey, at least they're willing to give this baby a chance (and I'm sure their readers will be thrilled about all those potential mods).<br><br>All in all, Stranded: Alien Dawn is an absolute blast (pun intended). If you're looking for a survival game that'll keep you busy for hours on end and make you feel like you're actually building a new civilization – look no further! And hey, who knows? You might just find yourself stranded on this alien planet, but don't worry; I won't tell anyone it's because you got stuck in the infinite loop of \"Surviving\" mode...",
