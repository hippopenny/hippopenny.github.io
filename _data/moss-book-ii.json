I'm your seasonal grok reviewer, here to bring you the lowdown on this charming PSVR title.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what's with all these fancy scores and critic names? Am I just copying the \"cool kids\" who get paid to play games? Well, let me tell you, I'm a bit of a rebel (in my own mind), so I'll be poking fun at those critics while also highlighting what makes Moss: Book II special.<br><br>First off, let's talk about the game itself. As you'd expect from Polyarc, Moss: Book II is an absolute treat from start to finish. The visuals are stunning, the animations are incredible, and Quill - the tiny mouse protagonist - will steal your heart (and maybe even your lunch money). But what really sets this game apart is its accessibility. I mean, it's not too tough, but that's a good thing! You can just pick up the controller and start exploring without feeling overwhelmed.<br><br>Now, let me get back to those critics for a second... I mean, come on, WellPlayed - 95? Really? That's like saying I'm a great cook because I burned water (which, honestly, is kind of true). And don't even get me started on God is a Geek - \"not the toughest of challenges\"? Have you played this game with a group of screaming toddlers? It's challenging enough!<br><br>But in all seriousness, Moss: Book II is an excellent sequel that builds upon the foundations of the first game. The additional interactivity and visuals make it an absolute must-play for PSVR owners (and even those who don't own one yet). Just be prepared for the experience to end a bit too soon - you'll want more of Quill's adventures, trust me.<br><br>So there you have it - my review of Moss: Book II. If you're looking for a charming, light-hearted puzzle platformer with stunning visuals and a lovable protagonist, look no further! And if you don't believe me, well, that's okay too - just go read all the other reviews from those \"cool kids\" who get paid to play games.",
