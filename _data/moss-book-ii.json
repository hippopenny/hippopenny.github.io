As I settle in with my PSVR headset, I'm excited to see how this sequel fares on the platform that has aged like a fine wine... or an old hippo.<br><br>Let's start with what everyone loves about Moss: its lovable protagonist Quill and her adorable antics. This little mouse is back, and she's bigger than ever! Okay, maybe not bigger, but certainly more confident and determined to explore this enchanting world. You'll control Quill as she navigates through beautifully crafted environments, solving puzzles, and avoiding obstacles. It's a true delight!<br><br>Now, about those critics. IGN gave it an 80, stating that while the game builds upon its predecessor nicely, it's let down by the PSVR's aging tech. Vandal praised the game with an 88, saying it shows how to create a fantastic VR experience (something I'm sure even us lowly reviewers can learn from). SpazioGames chimed in with an 83, mentioning that while the game improves upon the original, it's still hampered by PSVR's technical limitations. Eurogamer recommended the game without giving a score, saying it deserves to be played despite some minor drawbacks (like those pesky bugs that GamingTrend mentioned). COGconnected gave it a 90, calling it a remarkable sequel that improves upon everything from the original. And finally, Eurogamer Italy gave it an 80, stating it's not groundbreaking but still incredibly entertaining.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, I think Moss: Book II is a delightful adventure that shines brightly in VR. It's a true treat for anyone who loves platformers and exploration games. While some critics have noted the PSVR's technical limitations, I think Polyarc has done an amazing job of working within those constraints to create an engaging and beautiful experience.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny says Moss: Book II is a must-play for any VR enthusiast or fan of platformers. It's a charming adventure that will leave you smiling and eager for more!",
