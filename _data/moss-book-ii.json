This sequel has been getting rave reviews from critics, so let's see if it lives up to the hype.<br><br>First off, kudos to Polyarc for creating a game that looks stunning even on old tech (looking at you, PSVR). The art direction is simply gorgeous, with lush environments and adorable characters. Quill, the little mouse protagonist, is as charming as ever, and I love how she interacts with her environment.<br><br>Now, let's talk gameplay. Moss: Book II builds upon its predecessor nicely, adding more platforming challenges and a bigger world to explore. The controls are still smooth and responsive, making it a joy to navigate Quill through the levels.<br><br>But what really sets this game apart is its emotional storytelling. I won't spoil the story for you, but let's just say that Polyarc has done an amazing job of crafting a narrative that will tug at your heartstrings. It's not just about the gameplay; it's about the journey you take with Quill.<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning the critics' scores.
