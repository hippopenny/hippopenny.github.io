First off, let me say that these critics are a clever bunch... most of them, anyway. Okay, okay, I'll get to their reviews in a bit.<br><br>Before we dive in, I want to give you a quick rundown: Moss: Book II is an adorable platformer that takes place in a vast, mystical world. You play as Quill, the same lovable mouse from the first game, but this time around, you're exploring new environments and overcoming obstacles like never before.<br><br>Now, let's see what those critics had to say...<br><br>IGN gave it an 80 and said it builds upon its predecessor nicely, which is music to my ears! Vandal chimed in with an 88, praising the game for being fantastic and showing how to create a VR game. SpazioGames agreed, giving it an 83 and saying it improves what the original did and is one of the best games on PSVR.<br><br>But, oh dear, not everyone was as enamored. GamingTrend gave it an 85, praising its novel use of VR but lamenting the presence of progress-blocking bugs. And COGconnected? Well, they went all out with a 90, calling it a swan song for PSVR and saying Polyarc managed to forge an adventure for the ages.<br><br>Now, I'm not going to lie; I've had my fair share of snags and hiccups while playing Moss: Book II. But, honestly, those small issues didn't detract from my overall experience. The world is enchanting, the platforming is a blast, and Quill is just as charming as ever.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, I'll leave you to wonder... or read other reviews for that matter!",
