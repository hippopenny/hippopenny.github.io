Capcom breathes new life into this survival horror classic, offering heart-pounding combat and spine-tingling exploration.

Whether you're a seasoned fan or a newcomer, this game provides a hair-raising journey through the dilapidated ruins of Raccoon City. Get ready to face your fears and survive the nightmare!",
