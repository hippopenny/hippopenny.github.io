With its mind-boggling scope and sprawling galaxies, this game is undoubtedly an epic work of science fiction wonder. And, boy, I'm not just talking about the views – we're talking cinematic vistas that'll leave you starstruck (pun intended)!<br><br>Now, let's dive into what critics have been saying. Movies Games and Tech gives Starfield a glowing 100 for being an \"epic work of science fiction wonder\" with \"brilliantly crafted\" main story and side-quests. Xbox Tavern echoes this sentiment, dubbing it the game of the year and praising its addictive nature. TrueAchievements lauds the sheer amount of content on offer, and Gamereactor UK notes that Starfield has set a new standard for RPGs.<br><br>However, not everyone is singing the same tune. Digital Spy and GamesHub both give it an 80, highlighting that while the game shines in certain areas (like its visuals and combat systems), it can sometimes fall short of expectations. And then there's The Jimquisition, who seemingly enjoyed Starfield for being a classic Bethesda experience – but hey, we won't hold that against them.<br><br>As I wrap up this review, I've got to say that Starfield is definitely one giant leap for gaming-kind. So grab your spaceship and get ready to chart a new course through the cosmos!",
