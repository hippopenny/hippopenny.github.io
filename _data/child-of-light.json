It's your pal here, back with another review that's sure to make you laugh, cry, and maybe even roll your eyes (in a good way... or not).<br><br>Today, I'm tackling the beautiful Child of Light, a JRPG that has captured the hearts of many, including yours truly. Now, before we get into the nitty-gritty, let me just say that I've got some serious props for Gamereactor Denmark, who gave this game a perfect score. I mean, who wouldn't want to give 100% to something as stunningly lovely as Child of Light?<br><br>But enough about those Danish folks (no offense, guys!). Let's get down to business and see what the rest of the critics have to say.<br><br>First off, DarkStation is basically begging you to play this game. Like, come on, go buy it now! And I can see why - the world is just so... whimsical. You know, like a fairy tale come true (which, coincidentally, is exactly what Child of Light is).<br><br>PSX Extreme is all about balance and pacing in this review, saying that the game has \"superior\" balancing and pacing. Now, I'm not sure what's superior about it (I mean, I think I do), but hey, who am I to argue with experts?<br><br>Pelit (Finland) just gives it a solid thumbs up, saying it looks \"pretty nice\" and plays \"pretty nice too.\" Yeah, no kidding - this game is like looking at a work of art (which, again, it kinda is).<br><br>Games Master UK gives Child of Light an 81%, calling it \"a beautiful and heartfelt testament to the JRPG formula.\" Um, yeah... because JRPGs are all about being heartwarming and pretty.<br><br>And then there's Eurogamer, who loves this game almost as much as they love using big words. They say it's a \"wonderfully realised venture into unfamiliar territory\" - basically, they're saying it's like discovering a hidden treasure chest of JRPG goodness (which, let's be real, is exactly what happens when you play Child of Light).<br><br>And finally, we have Edge Magazine, who... well, actually, they kind of hate this game. They say it \"feels oddly empty,\" which, honestly, doesn't even make sense - there are like, so many characters and things to do! Maybe they just didn't understand the art of JRPGing? <br><br>Anyway, that's my review in a nutshell (or rather, a hippo shell). Child of Light is an amazing game that will capture your heart, your imagination, and maybe even make you laugh (if you're as goofy as me).<br><br>So go ahead, give it a try - I promise you won't regret it!",
