It's your boy, back with another review that's guaranteed to make you LOL so hard, you'll spit out your coffee (or energy drink, or whatever you're sipping on).<br><br>Gigantic: Rampage Edition, the re-release of an oldie but a goodie, is here to bring the nostalgia train straight to your gaming station. And I'm not just talking about the folks who grew up playing this game back in its heyday (you know, like Hardcore Gamer). No, no! Even us young whippersnappers can appreciate some good ol' MOBA action.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What's the hype, mate?\" Well, let me tell you. Abstraction's re-release has brought back all the heroes we love (and some new ones too), with their unique abilities and playstyles. It's like stepping into a time machine, but instead of getting stuck in the past, we get to experience it anew!<br><br>But don't just take my word for it. The critics have been having a blast (pun intended) with Gigantic: Rampage Edition. Even Screen Rant gave it props, saying it was \"worth bringing back.\" Yaaas, I agree! The unique mechanics and large cast of characters make this game stand out from the crowd.<br><br>Of course, not everyone is sold on the re-release. GamingBolt gave it a more lukewarm reception, saying it still falls short in some fundamental ways. And But Why Tho? thought it was a valiant effort, but maybe didn't offer enough to entice new players. Okay, okay, I get it – not everyone's going to love this game. But hey, at least it's trying, right?<br><br>So, what does the future hold for Gigantic: Rampage Edition? Will we see more updates and expansions? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure – if this takes off (pun intended again), maybe we can even get a Battleborn revival in the works! Can you imagine the scenario? \"Hey, remember that game that was just as fun to play seven years ago?\" Yeah, let's make more of those!<br><br>In conclusion, Gigantic: Rampage Edition is a blast from the past (get it?) that brings back all the fun and excitement. If you haven't played it before, now's your chance to join in on the action! And if you have played it before, well – it's time to relive those nostalgia-filled moments!<br><br>Stay groovy, gaming friends!",
