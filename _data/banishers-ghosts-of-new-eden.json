    "comment": "Step into the haunted streets of New Eden in Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and prepare for a ghoulishly good time. While the game doesn't quite reach the heights of essential gaming, it conjures up a compelling story of love, human misery, and social themes. The stiff combat system may feel as imprecise as a ghostly apparition, but the overall gameplay elements and relatively tough decisions make for a solid gaming experience. Don't Nod have crafted another beautiful world to haunt, but beware that some of the initial allure may fade over time. Whether you're a ghost hunting aficionado or just looking for a grim and gripping tale, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is worth a haunting visit.",
