The game truly shines when played with friends, as the local co-op features and variety of modes provide immense fun. Its love letter to kaiju cinema is evident, with top-notch Titan designs and entertaining combat. While the solo and online play options may not offer as much, Gigabash is a fantastic addition to any party-style gaming rotation.",
