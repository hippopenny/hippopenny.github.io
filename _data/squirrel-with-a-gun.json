    "comment": "Hippo Penny! Welcome to the most epic review of Squirrel With A Gun, where we dive into the wild world of... well, a squirrel with a gun. I mean, who wouldn't want that in their life?<br><br>So, let's get this party started by discussing the technical issues and somewhat cheap-looking visuals that, oh boy, sound like a blast! \"Janky charm,\" indeed. Who needs polish when you can have physics-based challenges that occasionally defy logic? I mean, who needs to make sense of Squirrel With A Gun when you can just experience its sheer absurdity?<br><br>GameGrin gave the game a 70 for being silly and crazy, which is about right. It's not like it has much of a story or anything – a quick distraction before getting back to your life of normalcy. But hey, who needs narrative depth when you have squirrels with guns? Not the developers of Squirrel With A Gun, that's for sure.<br><br>On the other hand, IGN was disappointed. I mean, what's not to love about a game where technical issues and hard crashes are just part of the experience? They were looking forward to more depth... in a game with shallow combat and short runtime. Yeah, that's exactly what we needed – less content and more frustration!<br><br>GameTrend, however, managed to detail both the technical issues (how original) and somewhat cheap-looking visuals, while still finding fun value in this little number. Maybe it's their optimism? They even compared it positively to... a collection of nuts.<br><br>Gameliner was kind enough to remind everyone that there's nothing funnier than squirrels shoving nuts down their throats, but somehow missed the fact that Squirrel With A Gun doubles down on this concept. Unfortunately for them (and us), technical difficulties were doing a serious number on Dee Dee Creations' game.<br><br>Checkpoint Gaming said hello to jankiness and good game design choices... which they wish was used in a more enjoyable experience! Who wouldn't want fun challenges without the extra added annoyance of frustrating gameplay? The bosses sounded about it, though – those crazy fights will stay with you for, well, not long enough!<br><br>Multiplayer.it just shrugged, saying \"Quotation forthcoming.\" Yeah, that's what we needed – an actual review or some sort of conclusion.<br><br>That sums up Squirrel With A Gun: a squirrely adventure with varying degrees of disappointment and jankiness. And by that, I mean it should be experienced live for the most thrilling experience... or not at all?",
