    "comment": "Surviving the Aftermath delivers a post-apocalyptic city-building survival experience that hits the mark with its addictive progression and upgrade system. While it may not offer anything groundbreaking to the genre, the game keeps you engaged in making critical decisions to keep your colony alive. Despite some graphical shortcomings, the game compensates with its rich gameplay and RPG elements.",
