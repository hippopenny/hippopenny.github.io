    "comment": "Surviving the Aftermath is a city-building survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. While the game doesn't bring anything particularly groundbreaking to the genre, its addictive gameplay and mechanically dense city management provide an enjoyable sim builder experience. The progression and upgrade system keep you engaged, but there's a constant feeling of familiarity throughout. Despite its graphical shortcomings, the game rocks typical RPG elements and offers a high-stakes building experience where making the right decisions is crucial for survival.",
