They're like the underachiever in school, always coming in second best to the superstar siblings (cough, FIFA, cough). But MLB The Show 24 is different - it's like the kid who finally gets a B+, you know? Not exactly an A-student, but it's got all the right stuff.<br><br>Now, before I dive into this review, let me just say that I'm not exactly the most unbiased of reviewers. I mean, have you seen my other articles? (\"MLB The Show 24: It's Okay, I Guess\"? Not catchy, I know.) But seriously, folks, MLB The Show 24 is a great game that's definitely worth your hard-earned cash.<br><br>Taking my lead from the critics (heh), **GamingTrend** calls it \"the ace of the sports sim industry,\" and with good reason. Last year's Storylines mode has been improved upon (improved? Really?), and the little tweaks to existing game modes are like adding a sprinkle of magic dust on top of the already-fine foundation.<br><br>And do I need to mention **God is a Geek**'s glowing review, where they call it \"a wonderfully curated sports sim\"? That guy's always positive - he must have a PhD in happiness (in addition to gaming, obvs).<br><br>Now, for those skeptics out there, I've got some bad news - like **Atomix**, which gives it an 83, stating that we're all just happy to be playing baseball at all. (Sorry, Atomix; gotta keep it real.)<br><br>But wait! Even the grumpiest of critics (**GameSpot** with its puny 70) can't deny the series' \"commendable output\" and fantastic gameplay.<br><br>As a hippo in the game-journalism jungle, I've got some fun facts for you:<br><br>* **Eurogamer Portugal** gave it an impressive 60, praising its Storylines mode, but not being too keen on everything else.<br>* And, if you didn't do your homework like me (ahem, **Checkpoint Gaming**), don't worry; the game's still got plenty of familiar faces to welcome new players.<br><br>All in all, MLB The Show 24 is a solid addition to the series - no superstars this time around, but just plain old-fashioned greatness. If you're looking for a fun baseball experience that won't break the bank (no free tickets guaranteed), then MLB The Show 24's your jam!",
