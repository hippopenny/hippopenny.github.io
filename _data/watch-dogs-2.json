And by \"wonderful,\" I mean some of these folks have completely lost their marbles.<br><br>Let's talk about Cheat Code Central first. They gave this game a whopping score of 98, and I'm pretty sure they must've been high-fiving themselves as they typed those words: \"The UI is wonderful.\" Wow, I wish more critics could be so concise (and enthusiastic). <br><br>Now, onto Twinfinite! These guys really pulled out all the stops, didn't they? Their glowing praise made Watch Dogs 2 sound like the next Coming of an era. I mean, who wouldn't want a game that's \"alive with variety\" and has a hero we can stand behind without question? Maybe someone from Time Magazine should take some notes.<br><br>Merlin'in Kazan was another reviewer who gave this game a solid thumbs up... which is short for (Turkish slang alert) a super nice shoutout. The UI of their language skills must be wonderful too, by the way. Kudos to them!<br><br>Sydney Morning Herald? Who knew they were into Watch Dogs 2? Wait, let me check their past reviews; it seems they're more of a cricket- watching crowd. But hey, I guess you've got to applaud their outside-of-the-box thinking when it comes to reviewing Watch Dogs<br><br>Last but not least (for now), we have those hipster critics at Meristation and Attack of the Fanboy! Both thought this game was off-the-chain with excellent open-worldness and mind-blowing hacking mechanics. Yikes, maybe I should brush up on my vocabulary too? Their scores were 80s across the board, which means... they must be \"fans\" in more ways than one?<br><br>The time it takes to review those critics would take longer to say 'watch'. I mean a whopping average of... (my math skills are rusty)... did anyone actually get paid for reviewing Watch Dogs <br><br>Anyway, now my own score is irrelevant (if you were waiting for me to give this game a grade). I just hope everyone enjoyed the hippo dance...",
