    "comment": "Lego Jurassic World takes you on a prehistoric adventure through the iconic movie franchise, but don't expect groundbreaking gameplay. The game falls short on innovation and feels like a nostalgic trip rather than a leap forward. While it captures the essence of Jurassic Park, the repetitive mechanics may leave you craving something more thrilling. However, fans of the movies will appreciate the humor and references, making it a decent addition to your Lego game collection.",
