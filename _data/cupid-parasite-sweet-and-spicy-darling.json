I'm not talking about your run-of-the-mill romance novels here; nope, this game is all about the Otome genre, where you play as the protagonist and navigate love stories with various bachelors.<br><br>Now, let's get to those critics. Nintendo World Report gave it an 80, saying Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is like a masterclass in storytelling, building upon the original game seamlessly. They praised the improved text, making it easy for newcomers (or people like me who played the original at launch) to jump in.<br><br>God is a Geek, on the other hand, gave it a 75, stating that while Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is lovely, it's hard to get into without playing the original. You know what they say: you can't have your cake and eat it too... or in this case, you can't play Sweet and Spicy Darling without devouring Cupid Parasite first.<br><br>Cubed3 and Digitally Downloaded both gave it a 90, with Cubed3 calling it \"balanced backstory telling\" and Digitally Downloaded describing it as \"artfully unique\" and \"downright entertaining.\" These critics are like the fairy godmothers of gaming reviews – they sprinkle magic dust on everything they touch!<br><br>Gamer Escape, however, was more lukewarm, giving Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling a 60. They thought it should've been DLC instead of a full-fledged sequel. I guess that's what happens when you try to make the whole package – sometimes less is more (just ask my Aunt Mildred).<br><br>Tech-Gaming gave it an 81, saying Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is all about \"compelling codas\" and \"flawed bachelors flourishing thanks to the virtues of romance.\" I think they're trying to say that this game is like a warm hug on a cold winter day – it's all about spreading love and joy!<br><br>And finally, GLHF on Sports Illustrated gave it a 60, stating that Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is \"all over the place,\" mixing slice-of-life storytelling with exciting set pieces. They thought it was confusing at times, but still enjoyed certain aspects of the game.<br><br>So, what's the takeaway from these critics? Well, if you played Cupid Parasite, then you'll love the sequel! It seems to be a masterclass in storytelling, building upon the original seamlessly. But if you skipped the original, you might find it hard to get into... unless you're like me and enjoy playing catch-up (just kidding – I don't have time for that!).<br><br>In conclusion, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a visual novel that's all about love, romance, and relationships. It's got its ups and downs, but overall, it's a delightful ride filled with interesting characters, sweet moments, and spicy surprises. So grab your favorite snacks, put on your comfiest PJs, and get ready to fall in love (again) with Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling!",
