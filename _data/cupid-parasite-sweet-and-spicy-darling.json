As I played through this visual novel, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd be the next critic to go gaga over its charm. And let me tell you, it's a wild ride!<br><br>First off, I want to address my fellow critics who've given this game high scores - NintendoWorldReport (80), Digitally Downloaded (90), and Tech-Gaming (81) - I'm not sure what kind of magical elixir they're drinking, but I think I need some. Their glowing reviews had me expecting a masterpiece, but was it really that good?<br><br>Let's get to the gameplay! As you'd expect from an otome game, Sweet and Spicy Darling is all about the romance. You'll follow the story of Cupid Parasite's protagonist as she navigates six new paths with suitors, each with their own unique charm (pun intended). The game does an excellent job of weaving in reminders for newcomers - or even those like me who skipped the original - to help them catch up.<br><br>Now, I won't lie; at times, it felt like playing a choose-your-own-adventure book with more romance than a Harlequin novel. But hey, that's what makes otome games so delightful! The endings are where this game truly shines, offering not one, not two, but three flavors - sweet, spicy, or balanced. It's like having a box of chocolates (or in my case, a bag of sour candies) - you never know which way it'll go!<br><br>But here's the thing: some critics have said that Sweet and Spicy Darling is only enjoyable if you've played the original Cupid Parasite. I'm not convinced; while playing without knowledge of the first game might limit your understanding of the story, it doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.<br><br>Gamer Escape (60) seems to agree with me on this point, saying that Sweet and Spicy Darling should have been a DLC instead of a full-fledged game. I get their point; the lack of world-building and character development might make it hard for new players to jump in. However, if you're willing to overlook those shortcomings, there's still plenty to enjoy.<br><br>GLHF on Sports Illustrated (60) has another interesting take - while they found the game enjoyable, they felt it was a bit all over the place, mixing genres and story elements that didn't quite mesh. I can understand their frustration; sometimes, less is more, and Sweet and Spicy Darling might be trying too hard to please.<br><br>In conclusion, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a love letter to otome game enthusiasts everywhere. Is it perfect? No way - but hey, what's perfect in life, anyway? If you're looking for a wacky, romantic adventure with a dash of surprise endings, then this might be the game for you.<br><br>So, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling - again!",
