I mean, I've heard the genre can be a bit... niche. But hey, I'm always up for trying new things (mostly because my wallet loves me for it).<br><br>So, what's the deal with Sweet and Spicy Darling? Is it just a rehashed version of the original Cupid Parasite game, or is it something entirely new? Well, let me tell you, if you're new to the series, don't worry - these critics are all about making sure you don't get lost. Even NintendoWorldReport says so! \"Reminder points as to what happened with each of the suitors in the original six paths\" - yeah, that's exactly what I need: a refresher course on who's who and what's what.<br><br>Now, I know some of my fellow critics (cough, cough, Gamer Escape) might say that Sweet and Spicy Darling should've been DLC instead. But hey, who doesn't love an excuse to buy more games? Am I right?<br><br>Tech-Gaming agrees with me on this one - Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is all about the journey, not just the destination. And Digitally Downloaded says it's a \"game you should play\" - high praise indeed!<br><br>But don't get too excited just yet - GLHF on Sports Illustrated has some mixed feelings (chocolate... ugh). And God is a Geek is a bit more skeptical, saying it's hard to jump in without playing the original first. <br><br>So, what's my takeaway? Well, let me put it this way: Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is like that one friend who shows up at your party with a surprise cake - you're not sure if you want to eat it all, but you appreciate the effort. It's got its quirks, but it's also got some great moments.<br><br>That's my review in a nutshell! (Or should I say, in a spicy otome game?).
