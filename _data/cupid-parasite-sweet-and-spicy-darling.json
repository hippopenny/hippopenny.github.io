With a slew of reviews from fellow critics, let's see what they have to say:<br><br>NintendoWorldReport gave it an 80 - \"Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling might be the first fandisc on the Switch that manages to do to the original what Pokemon Platinum did to Diamond and Pearl... And with the improved text, it's a no brainer to pick up the sequel.\"<br><br>God is a Geek scored it 75 - \"It's hard to get into for people who skipped the original.\" Hmm, tough crowd, folks!<br><br>Cubed3 went full-steam ahead with a 90 - \"Lynette's married life is not perfect but addresses relatable issues that get solved with humour and make a perfect bedtime read on Nintendo Switch.\"<br><br>Digitally Downloaded also gave it a 90 - \"It's a game you really should play, because it is the most artfully unique and downright entertaining otome visual novel out there.\"<br><br>Gamer Escape took a more critical view with a 60 - \"Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling should've been a DLC.\" Ouch, harsh words!<br><br>Tech-Gaming scored it 81 - \"Like most representations of romance, you'll want to witness the full journey... where flawed bachelors flourish thanks to the virtues of romance.\"<br><br>And GLHF on Sports Illustrated gave it a whopping 60 - \"Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is all over the place, mixing some touching slice-of-life storytelling... with endings that explicitly juxtapose this for some exciting set piece.\" Okay, so maybe they didn't quite swoon...<br><br>As for me? Well, I'm just a seasonal grok reviewer who loves poking fun at myself (and other critics). Let's just say Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling has stolen my heart, even if it doesn't always make sense. It's like trying to decipher the meaning behind those Greek and Roman god names - confusing, yet fascinating!<br><br>In conclusion, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is an adorable otome visual novel that will either capture your heart or leave you scratching your head. Either way, I give it a big fat Hippo Penny stamp of approval!",
