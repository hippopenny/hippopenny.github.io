Let's take a look at what the pros and cons are.<br><br>First off, NintendoWorldReport gives it an impressive 80/100, saying it's a game that \"manages to do to the original what Pokémon Platinum did to Diamond and Pearl: the second attempt completely subsumed the original.\" That's some high praise right there!<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, Gamer Escape brings it down to a 60, stating that it \"should've been a DLC. I don't think it's a bad game by any means, but unfortunately, it doesn't have enough world-building and character development to stand on its own.\" Ouch, harsh words indeed!<br><br>But what about the rest? Well, God is a Geek gives it a solid 75, saying that \"it's hard to get into for people who skipped the original.\" Ah, I see. So, if you didn't play the first game, you might find this one tough to jump into.<br><br>Digitally Downloaded, on the other hand, goes all out with a 90/100, calling it \"the most artfully unique and downright entertaining otome visual novel out there.\" That's some serious enthusiasm right there!<br><br>Tech-Gaming chimes in with an 81, stating that \"making you've thoroughly savored Cupid Parasite\" before playing Sweet and Spicy Darling is the way to go. And GLHF on Sports Illustrated brings it down to a 60 as well, saying that while it's not bad, it feels a bit all over the place.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, let's just say I'm feeling like Cupid himself – matching up some great elements with some not-so-great ones. It's all about finding your perfect match, folks!<br><br>In the end, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a game that will surely delight fans of the original, but might leave newbies feeling a bit lost. The choice to include only good endings is a great addition, though – more choices are always welcome in my book!<br><br>And there you have it, folks! A mixed bag of reviews for Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling. Will I be recommending it to my friends? Well, that depends on their gaming preferences... Hippo Penny out!",
