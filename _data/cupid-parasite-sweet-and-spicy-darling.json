I mean, who doesn't love a good otome game with multiple story paths?<br><br>First off, let me just say that NintendoWorldReport is really selling it hard with their 80/100 score. Like, they're basically calling this sequel a game-changer - even better than Pok√©mon Platinum (yes, really). Meanwhile, God is a Geek is all like, \"Yeah, but what if you didn't play the original?\" Um, isn't that the point of a fandisc? To build on what came before?<br><br>Digitally Downloaded, however, is just gushing over the aesthetics and presentation. I mean, artfully unique and downright entertaining? That's some serious praise! And honestly, who wouldn't want to jump into this game with its reminder points for newcomers (or people like me who played the original at launch...30 months ago)?<br><br>Now, Gamer Escape is being a bit more realistic - saying that Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling should've been DLC. I mean, it's not bad by any means, but it doesn't quite stand on its own with regards to world-building and character development.<br><br>Tech-Gaming is all about relishing the full journey of romance in this game, where flawed bachelors flourish thanks to the virtues of love. And GLHF on Sports Illustrated? Well, they're saying that while parts are touching, others feel confusing and lost - like when you order chocolate cake by mistake (I mean, I don't actually like chocolate).<br><br>In conclusion, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a game that's all about the journey, not just the destination. If you've played the original, you'll get to see how your choices affected the story - and if you haven't, it's still a fun experience with plenty of surprises.<br><br>So, will I be playing this fandisc without the original? Hell yes! Who needs comfort when you can have surprise?<br><br>Now, go forth and read all about Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling on your favorite review site (hint, hint).",
