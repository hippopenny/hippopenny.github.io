As I waded through the critic reviews, I couldn't help but chuckle at some of the more... colorful opinions. Let me tell you, it's been a wild ride.<br><br>First off, NintendoWorldReport gave it an 80 and said it's like Pokémon Platinum – yep, that good! They praised how easily newcomers can jump in and get started, with reminder points for those who played the original (30 months ago? Whoa, I'm impressed!).<br><br>On the other hand, God is a Geek gave it a 75, but only if you've played the original Cupid Parasite. For newbies, they said it's like trying to join a party after it's already started – hard to get in! Ouch.<br><br>Now, Cubed3 and Digitally Downloaded both raved about Sweet and Spicy Darling, calling it a \"wonderful take\" (80) and \"artfully unique\" (90), respectively. They praised the game's presentation, menus, and wildly different plot routes. It seems even the most jaded critics couldn't resist Cupid Parasite's charms!<br><br>However, Gamer Escape was less convinced, giving it a 60 and saying it should've been DLC instead of a full-fledged sequel. They felt it lacked world-building and character development. Sorry, not sorry?<br><br>Last but not least, Tech-Gaming gave it an 81, emphasizing the importance of playing Cupid Parasite first to fully appreciate Sweet and Spicy Darling's \"compelling codas.\" I mean, who doesn't love a good coda? <br><br>And then there was GLHF on Sports Illustrated, which gave it a 60. They called it \"all over the place\" and said some parts felt confused and lost. Apparently, this critic is not a fan of chocolate (or maybe they just don't like surprises?).<br><br>All in all, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling seems to be a visual novel that's got its fans and its detractors. If you're new to the series, it might take some effort to get started. But if you're already invested, you'll probably find plenty to love!",
