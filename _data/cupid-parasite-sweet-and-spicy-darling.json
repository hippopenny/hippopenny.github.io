Or at least, make it flutter in excitement!<br><br>Now, let's get to the juicy stuff – Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling. This game is like a rich, velvety-smooth hot chocolate on a chilly day. It warms your heart, makes you feel all fuzzy inside, and leaves you wanting more.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Let's see what the critics have to say:<br><br>* NintendoWorldReport gives it an 80%: \"Sweet and Spicy Darling might be the first fandisc on the Switch that manages to do to the original what Pokémon Platinum did to Diamond and Pearl: the second attempt completely subsumed the original.\"<br>* God is a Geek gives it a 75%: \"Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a wonderful take on the Otome genre, but it's hard to get into for people who skipped the original.\"<br>* Digitally Downloaded gives it a 90%: \"There’s not much else I can say, given that any commentary on the story would be a spoiler to the first game... Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a sequel to a game you should play before it. But it's also a game you really should play, because it is the most artfully unique and downright entertaining otome visual novel out there.\"<br>* Gamer Escape gives it a 60%: \"Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling should've been a DLC. I don't think it’s a bad game by any means, but unfortunately, it doesn’t have enough world-building and character development to stand on its own.\"<br>* GLHF on Sports Illustrated gives it a 60%: \"Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is all over the place... The choice to include only good endings, sweet, spicy, or balanced flavors, is a great addition... However, whether it's mixing up the genres, or using Greek and Roman god names interchangeably, something feels confused and lost.\"<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, let me tell you – I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a masterpiece. It's like a perfectly crafted love letter to otome fans everywhere. The story is engaging, the characters are memorable, and the endings are... well, let's just say they're as sweet as can be!<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Go ahead, give it a try, and see what you think. Trust me, you won't regret it.<br><br>That's it for this review, folks! Thanks for tuning in, and I'll catch you all on the flip side!",
