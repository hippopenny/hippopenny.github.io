But before we get to that, let's take a look at what some other critics have had to say.<br><br>NintendoWorldReport gave it an impressive 80%, praising how Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling \"completely subsumed\" the original, making it easy for newcomers (or old-timers like me) to jump in. God is a Geek was a bit more hesitant, giving it a 75% and saying that it's hard to get into without playing the original first.<br><br>On the other hand, Cubed3 gave it a glowing 90%, calling it \"wonderful\" and praising its balanced storytelling and eye-catching visuals. Digitally Downloaded also gave it a 90%, but was more cryptic in their praise, saying that Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is simply the most unique and entertaining Otome visual novel out there.<br><br>Gamer Escape was a bit more down on the game, giving it a 60% and saying that it should have been DLC rather than a full-fledged sequel. Tech-Gaming gave it an 81%, praising its \"compelling codas\" and how it's fun to play without having played the original first.<br><br>And then there's GLHF on Sports Illustrated, who gave it a...well, also a 60%. They praised some of its elements, like the inclusion of only good endings, but were overall underwhelmed by the game. (I mean, who doesn't love a good chocolate-themed pun?)<br><br>Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get to my review!<br><br>As someone who hasn't played the original Cupid Parasite, I was a bit worried that I'd be lost in this fandisc. But surprise, surprise! Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is actually really easy to pick up, with clear reminders of what happened in the original game (plus some fun cameos from those bachelors). The story is still as sweet and spicy as ever, with each route taking a few hours to complete. And let's be real - who doesn't love reading about Lynette's married life?<br><br>Of course, not everything is perfect. Some of the character development feels a bit lacking (Gamer Escape had a point there), and some parts of the story feel a bit...over-the-top. But overall? Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a delightful addition to any Otome fan's library.<br><br>So what are you waiting for? Go give it a try, and let me know what you think!",
