As I embark on this delightful journey, I'll be sure to sprinkle in some humor, self-deprecation, and fun for young players.<br><br>Let's start with the critics. Oh boy, are they...interesting. NintendoWorldReport gave it an 80, saying it \"completely subsumed\" the original (whatever that means). God is a Geek thought it was wonderful but hard to get into without playing the first game. Digitally Downloaded breathlessly enthused about its aesthetics and presentation, calling it the \"most artfully unique and downright entertaining otome visual novel out there.\" Gamer Escape deemed it \"not bad\" but lacking in world-building and character development. And GLHF on Sports Illustrated found it \"all over the place\" with some great storytelling and character arcs, but ultimately felt confused.<br><br>Now that we've got our critic's quotes out of the way, let's get to the good stuff! Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a visual novel that follows up on the original game. It's like getting a second helping of your favorite dessert (or in this case, a sweet and spicy flavor). The game does an excellent job of recapping what happened in each of the six paths, making it easy for newcomers or those who played the original 30 months ago to jump back in.<br><br>The gameplay is where things get really sweet. You'll navigate through stories, make choices, and enjoy the fruits of your labor (or should I say, the flavors of your love interests). The addition of only good endings – sweet, spicy, or balanced – is a great touch, keeping things fresh and exciting.<br><br>But here's the thing: Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling isn't just about the gameplay; it's an experience. It's like taking a bite out of that perfect cupcake – it's a delight from start to finish.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a game that will make your heart skip a beat (or in this case, make your taste buds do the tango), Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is the perfect treat. Just remember, as GLHF on Sports Illustrated said, \"There was a lot left to be desired...but there's definitely parts I enjoyed about Sweet and Spicy Darling.\" Ah, who am I kidding? This game is a must-play!<br><br>That's it for my review! Hippo Penny out!",
