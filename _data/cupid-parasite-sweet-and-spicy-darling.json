It's your boy reviewing Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling, a visual novel that's got everyone swooning (except maybe those who don't like chocolate, like our friend from GLHF on Sports Illustrated). But I digress!<br><br>I'm gonna poke some fun at my fellow critics real quick. NintendoWorldReport thinks it's the perfect sequel because it remembers what happened in the original six paths? That's cute, folks! God is a Geek says new fans will have to play the original first? No duh, right? Cubed3 just wants to gush about how balanced the story telling is (I'm looking at you, friend!). Digitally Downloaded can't even breathelessly enthuse without spoiling the first game (kudos for self-restraint, buddy!).<br><br>Now, let's get to my review! I'll keep it sweet and spicy, just like this lovely otome visual novel. Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a delightful follow-up that does everything right. The story is engaging, with each route taking a few hours of playtime (depending on your reading speed, of course). Returning fans will be thrilled to see what happens during the happy-ever-after version of the original tale. And new fans? You'll be swooning over the adorable Lynette and her bachelors in no time!<br><br>The game's presentation is top-notch, with an eye-catching color palette that pairs perfectly with easy-to-use menus. I mean, who doesn't love a good visual novel experience on their Nintendo Switch?<br><br>Now, about those criticisms: Gamer Escape thinks it should've been DLC? Sorry, friends! Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is more than just a sprinkle of extra content. GLHF on Sports Illustrated says it's all over the place? I get that feeling sometimes when life gets messy (or in this case, when the game gets too adventurous). But hey, at least there are no chocolates left unloved!<br><br>So, if you're ready for some sweet and spicy romance on your Switch, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is the perfect treat. Hippo Penny approved!",
