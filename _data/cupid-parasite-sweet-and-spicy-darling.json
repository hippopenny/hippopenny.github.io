Now, I know what you're thinking - is this game still sweet and spicy without playing the original? Let me give you the lowdown.<br><br>First off, props to NintendoWorldReport for being the \"cool kid\" in town. They swooped in with an 80% score, saying that Sweet and Spicy Darling is like Pok√©mon Platinum all over again - a sequel that improves upon the original! Whoa, high praise indeed!<br><br>God is a Geek had a slightly different take, giving it a 75%. They reckon you'll need to play the first game for maximum enjoyment. Ah, but what about those who skipped the original? Well, GLHF on Sports Illustrated says that's not a problem at all - they enjoyed the surprises and didn't feel left behind. Hmm, mixed signals, much?<br><br>Now, Digitally Downloaded is having none of it! They're all about that artful uniqueness and entertaining otome experience. Sweet and Spicy Darling gets a 90% from these folks, and I'm inclined to agree - this game is indeed a treat!<br><br>On the other hand, Gamer Escape is all like, \"Meh, it's fine, but not much more than DLC material.\" And that's exactly what I was worried about: would Sweet and Spicy Darling feel like an expansion pack rather than a fully-fledged sequel? Tech-Gaming seems to think so, giving it 81%. They say the endings are where it's at, and I won't argue with that!<br><br>So, what's my take on Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling? Well, let me put it this way: if you're new to the series, don't worry - just go for it! The game does a great job of reminding you what happened in the original without making you feel like a total newbie. And if you are returning from the first game, well, you'll be treated to some delightful surprises!<br><br>In conclusion, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a sweet treat (see what I did there?) that's sure to please fans of the otome genre. Just don't expect it to change your life... unless you're really into Greek and Roman god names being used interchangeably. Then, maybe, just maybe...",
