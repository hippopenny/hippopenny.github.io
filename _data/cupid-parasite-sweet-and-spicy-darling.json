I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned Otome visual novel, am I right?<br><br>Now, let's get down to business. The critics are having a field day with this one, and rightfully so! NintendoWorldReport says it's the first fandisc on Switch that does what Pok√©mon Platinum did for Diamond and Pearl - subsumes the original. That's some high praise right there!<br><br>But what about the others? Well, God is a Geek thinks it's hard to get into if you skipped the original (uh, hello, that's like saying you can't enjoy The Avengers without watching all the Marvel movies first). Cubed3 loves how balanced the backstory telling is and how each route takes a few hours of play depending on your reading speed. Digitally Downloaded can't stop raving about the aesthetics and presentation, saying it's artfully unique and downright entertaining.<br><br>Gamer Escape thinks it should've been a DLC (ouch, harsh criticism right there). Tech-Gaming agrees that you need to have played Cupid Parasite first, but hey, that's just part of the fun, right?<br><br>And then there's GLHF on Sports Illustrated - this one is all over the place! They love the slice-of-life storytelling and interesting character arcs, but also think it's confusing and lost in some places. Hmm, maybe they're just a little bitter because they don't like chocolate (just kidding, folks, I know that's not a real thing).<br><br>Anyway, what do I think? Well, let me put my grok hat on for a sec... Hmmm... Okay, got it! I think this game is all about the feels. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel all sorts of emotions as you navigate Lynette's love life. The choices are tough (which bachelor to start with?!), but that's what makes it so much fun!<br><br>So, if you're ready for a romantic adventure that'll keep you hooked, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is the game for you! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some Otome games to play...",
