I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' otome visual novel, am I right?<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Grok, why are you reviewing this game when it's clearly meant for the ladies?\" Well, let me tell you, my friends, I'm not here to discriminate against any genre or demographic. I'm all about bringing the fun and humor to our beloved gaming world.<br><br>Now, onto the review! Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a sequel that builds upon the original game's story and gameplay. And let me tell you, it's a wild ride! The game takes some risks by not holding your hand through its story, but I mean, who doesn't love a good mystery?<br><br>One thing I did notice was how each of the suitors' stories were laid out in a way that made sense for new players. Kudos to the developers for making sure newcomers can jump in and enjoy the game without feeling lost.<br><br>Now, let's talk about the critics. Oh boy, they're having a field day with this one! Nintendo World Report gave it an 80, saying it's like Pokemon Platinum did to Diamond and Pearl - the second attempt completely subsumed the original. God is a Geek gave it a 75, stating that it's hard to get into for people who skipped the original. Digitally Downloaded gave it a 90, calling it the most artfully unique and downright entertaining otome visual novel out there. Gamer Escape gave it a 60, saying it should've been DLC. And finally, GLHF on Sports Illustrated gave it a 60, saying it's all over the place.<br><br>But what do I think? Well, let's just say that Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a sweet treat for otome fans. It's a fun ride with some great storytelling and characters. And hey, even if you don't like chocolate (like our friend from GLHF on Sports Illustrated), there's still plenty to enjoy.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I'm not going to give it a score or anything. That's up to you, my friends! Just remember - Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is all about taking risks and having fun with its story and gameplay. So, go ahead and take a chance on this otome visual novel!<br><br>And that's it for this review, folks! I hope you enjoyed the ride as much as I did. See you in the next one!",
