Now, I know what you're thinking - what in the world is an otome visual novel? Well, let me tell you, it's a delightful mix of romance, drama, and humor that'll leave you swooning (or maybe not, depending on your taste in bachelors). <br><br>Now, let's get to the reviews. I've got a whole crew of critics who've given their two cents, and I'm here to give you my two cents too! First up, we have Nintendo World Report giving Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling an impressive 80% score. They loved how the game \"completely subsumed\" the original, making it easy for new players (or those like me who played the original at launch) to jump in and get cozy with the characters. And hey, who can resist a good romance?<br><br>God is a Geek isn't quite as sold on the game, giving it 75%. They think it's hard for new players to get into without playing the original (ahem, what's a little replay value between friends?). But hey, if you're a fan of the series, you'll be in good company.<br><br>Cubed3 is all about balance - they give Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling a 90% score. They loved how each route took a few hours to play through, giving readers a chance to get cozy with the characters and their stories. Returning fans will be delighted to see what happens during the happy ever after version of the original tale.<br><br>Digitally Downloaded is all about artful uniqueness - they give Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling a 90% score too! They think it's the most unique and entertaining otome visual novel out there (and who can resist that?). But, alas, we have to play the first game before diving into this sequel.<br><br>Gamer Escape is less enthused - they give Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling a 60% score. They think it should've been DLC instead of a full-length game (I mean, who doesn't love a good expansion?). But hey, at least it's not bad?<br><br>Tech-Gaming thinks the same, giving Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling an 81%. They loved reliving the full journey, where flawed bachelors flourish thanks to the virtues of romance. And who can resist that?<br><br>GLHF on Sports Illustrated (yes, you read that right - it's a gaming review on Sports Illustrated!) is all over the place with their 60% score. They mix and match genres and character arcs, but something feels confused and lost (ahem, maybe they're just not as into otome games?). However, if you like to feel surprised rather than comforted, this might be your jam.<br><br>So there you have it - Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a delightful little gem that'll keep you swooning. Now, go forth and play (or replay) the original before diving into this sequel!",
