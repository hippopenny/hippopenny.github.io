I'm excited to share my thoughts on this game, but first, let me just say that I'm a bit self-conscious about being a seasonal reviewer. It's like being a pop star - you're only popular for a hot second before people move on to the next big thing. But hey, someone's gotta do it!<br><br>Now, onto the review! As you can see from the critics above, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling has received some mixed reviews. NintendoWorldReport loves it, God is a Geek thinks it's hard to get into without playing the original, Digitally Downloaded gives it a glowing review, Gamer Escape thinks it should have been DLC, and GLHF on Sports Illustrated is just confused by it all.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, I'll start by saying that as someone who didn't play the original Cupid Parasite, I did find it a bit hard to get into at first. The story is complex, with six different paths and multiple endings, but once you settle in, it's actually really sweet (pun intended). The characters are well-written, and the romance options are all unique and charming in their own ways.<br><br>One thing that did throw me off was the lack of world-building and character development. I get what Gamer Escape is saying - this game feels like a DLC rather than a full-fledged sequel. But at the same time, I think Digitally Downloaded's point about it being an artfully unique and entertaining otome visual novel is spot on.<br><br>In the end, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a fun ride for fans of the genre. If you're new to otome games, you might find it a bit challenging at first, but stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with some lovely storylines and character arcs. And hey, even if you don't like chocolate (like GLHF on Sports Illustrated), there's definitely something for everyone in this game.<br><br>That's all for now - I hope you enjoyed my review of Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling!",
