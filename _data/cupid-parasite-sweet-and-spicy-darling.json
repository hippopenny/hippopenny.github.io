I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned otome visual novel?<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Grok, why should I care about your review when there are so many other critics out there?\" Well, let me tell you, my friends. While those esteemed critics might have their fancy scores and whatnot, I'm here to give it to you straight - no pun intended.<br><br>So, what's the lowdown on Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling? In a nutshell (or should I say, in a Valentine's Day box?), it's all about the romance. You've got your bachelors, each with their own unique storylines, and then you've got the player character, who's trying to win over their hearts. Sounds simple enough, right?<br><br>But here's the thing - as NintendoWorldReport so cleverly put it, \"the sequel completely subsumed the original.\" In other words, if you didn't play the first game (Cupid Parasite), good luck understanding what's going on in Sweet and Spicy Darling!<br><br>Now, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. Heck, it's actually kind of brilliant. After all, who doesn't love a good mystery? And let me tell you, this otome visual novel has got mystery galore! So, if you're up for a challenge and don't mind playing catch-up (literally), then Sweet and Spicy Darling is the game for you!<br><br>But what about the critics, you ask? Well, let's just say they've got their opinions, and I've got mine. Tech-Gaming gave it an 81 out of 100, praising its \"compelling codas\" - or in other words, those sweet, spicy, or balanced endings that make your heart skip a beat! On the flip side, Gamer Escape thought it was just okay, saying it should have been DLC instead of a full-fledged sequel. And then there's GLHF on Sports Illustrated, who called it \"all over the place\" - but hey, I think that's just part of its charm!<br><br>So, what's my take on Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling? Well, let's just say I had a blast playing it (pun intended). It's like a big ol' box of chocolates - you never know what kind of treat you're going to get! And that's exactly what makes this otome visual novel so special.<br><br>So, there you have it - my review of Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling. If you're looking for a game that'll keep you guessing and make your heart skip a beat (or two), then give it a try! Just don't forget to play the first game - or at least, brush up on what happened before jumping into this sweet, spicy, and balanced adventure!<br><br>That's all for now, folks. See you in the next review!",
