As I jump into the game without prior knowledge of the original (gasp!), I'll share my thoughts on what makes this otome visual novel tick... or not.<br><br>First off, kudos to NintendoWorldReport for setting the bar high with their 80 out of 100 score. They praised how the sequel improved upon the original, making it accessible to newcomers while still catering to die-hard fans. I can see why; Sweet and Spicy Darling does an excellent job of recapping key events from the first game, allowing new players to jump in without feeling lost.<br><br>On the other hand, God is a Geek's 75 score suggests that, for some, this game might be harder to get into without prior knowledge. I can relate; as someone who plays games outside of their comfort zone, I appreciate how Cupid Parasite doesn't hold your hand through its story. However, I do wish the game provided more context or a brief summary of the original's events.<br><br>Now, onto Digitally Downloaded's glowing 90 score! They raved about the presentation and aesthetics, which – based on my experience – are indeed unique and captivating. While I won't spoil anything, I'll say that Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is all about embracing its quirks and exploring themes of love, relationships, and personal growth.<br><br>Meanwhile, Gamer Escape's 60 score might lead you to believe the game fell short, but honestly? It's just not their cup of tea. They felt the story didn't have enough world-building and character development to stand on its own, which is fair – Sweet and Spicy Darling is meant to be an extension of the original, not a standalone experience.<br><br>Last but not least, GLHF on Sports Illustrated's 60 score suggests that Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling can feel all over the place. While I agree that some parts might be jarring or confusing (like the mixing of genres or using Greek/Roman god names interchangeably), I think this is part of the game's charm.<br><br>In conclusion, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a delightful otome visual novel that, while not perfect, has its unique selling points. If you're new to the series, it might take some time to adjust, but if you're willing to dive in headfirst, you'll find an engaging story with memorable characters.<br><br>That's my Hippo Penny review of Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling – a game that, despite its quirks, won me over with its charm.",
