Here's my take on Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling.<br><br>I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - I played through the entire thing without having a clue about what all the fuss is about. See, I'm a seasonal grok (that means I play games during their respective seasons of release), so I didn't have time to indulge in the original Cupid Parasite... yet. But hey, that's what makes this review so special - it's like a mystery box full of surprises!<br><br>Now, let me just say that Sweet and Spicy Darling is one heck of an otome visual novel. The presentation is top-notch, with an eye-catching color palette and menus that are easy to navigate. And the story? Well, it's like a delicious slice-of-life cake with many layers - each route takes a few hours of play depending on your reading speed.<br><br>But what really gets my goat (in a good way) is how balanced the backstory telling is. You don't need to have played the original Cupid Parasite to jump in and quickly pick up what's being laid down. And with the improved text, it's like getting an extra layer of sweetness - I mean, spice! The choice to include only good endings (sweet, spicy, or balanced flavors) is a great addition, and something I've noticed otome games trending towards.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What about the critics?\" Well, let me just say that some folks are a bit too harsh on this game. For instance, NintendoWorldReport gave it an 80, but I think they should've gone higher! And don't even get me started on Gamer Escape's 60 - it's like they forgot to put on their romance goggles!<br><br>All in all, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a wonderful take on the Otome genre. If you're new to the series, it's still an amazing experience. And if you played the original? Well, then you know what to expect - more of the same, but better! So grab some chocolate (or your preferred treat), cozy up with Lynette and her bachelors, and get ready for a sweet and spicy adventure!",
