Yep, that's this one too. But don't worry, I'm not just going to swoon over the handsome suitors (although, let me tell you, they are quite... appealing). I'll give you my honest take on what makes Sweet and Spicy Darling tick.<br><br>First off, kudos to the developers for making a game that's perfect for newcomers and old fans alike. The reminders of what happened in the original six paths are super helpful, so even if you jumped into this sequel without playing the first one, you can still get a sense of the story. And honestly, who doesn't love having their memories jogged by a cute anime boy?<br><br>But let's talk about the gameplay. It's more of the same as Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is essentially an expansion pack for the original. Don't get me wrong - it's still fun! The improved text (which, might I add, is quite the accomplishment) makes it easy to jump back into the world without feeling lost.<br><br>Now, some critics out there are saying that this game doesn't stand on its own and should have been DLC instead. But hey, if you're going to go all in on a fandisc, at least do it with style, right? And let's not forget about those delicious-sounding flavor options - balanced, sweet, or spicy!<br><br>So, what did I think of Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling? Well, as someone who didn't play the original (don't judge me!), I found myself having a blast despite feeling a bit... out of the loop. But hey, that's part of the fun, right?<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a lighthearted otome game with some great character development and exciting plot twists, Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is definitely worth checking out. And if you did play the original? Well, you know what to do - dive back in and enjoy the ride!<br><br>That's it for this review! Thanks for joining me on this sweet adventure, and don't forget to check out my other reviews for more gaming fun!",
