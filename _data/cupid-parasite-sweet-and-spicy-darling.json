I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, though - this game is all about the feels, and if you're not prepared to get emotional, then maybe take a deep breath before diving in.<br><br>As for me, Hippo Penny? I'm just here for the snarky humor and witty one-liners (because, let's be real, life is too short for anything less). So, without further ado, let's dive into the review!<br><br>First off, let me say that these critics are some tough nuts to crack. Nintendo World Report gave it an impressive 80! Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling has clearly won them over with its improved text and reminder points for newbies (or oldies like me who need a refresher). The reviewer even compared it to Pok√©mon Platinum, saying the sequel \"completely subsumed\" the original. Now that's what I call an epic sequel!<br><br>Meanwhile, God is a Geek gave it a solid 75, praising the game's take on the Otome genre. They did, however, caution that it might be tough for newcomers (or those who skipped the original). Fair point, but hey, sometimes you just gotta jump in and see what happens, right?<br><br>Digitally Downloaded went all out with their review, giving it a whopping 90! They basically swooned over the aesthetics and presentation, saying it's \"artfully unique\" and \"downright entertaining\". I mean, who wouldn't want that in an otome visual novel? The only downside is that they spoiled the story (oops!), so if you haven't played the original, you might wanna wait until you have.<br><br>Gamer Escape, on the other hand, wasn't as thrilled. They gave it a 60, saying it should've been DLC instead of its own full-fledged game. I mean, fair point - sometimes less is more! And GLHF on Sports Illustrated agreed, giving it another 60. They said it's all over the place, mixing genres and using Greek and Roman god names interchangeably (yeah, that can be confusing!). BUT, they did enjoy the touchy slice-of-life storytelling and character arcs.<br><br>So there you have it, folks! Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling might not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a romantic drama-filled ride, then buckle up and get ready to swoon!<br><br>Hippo out!",
