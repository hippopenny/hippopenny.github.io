As I waded through the critics' reviews, I couldn't help but chuckle at some of their comments. Let's get this love fest started!<br><br>First off, NintendoWorldReport gave it an 80% score, calling it \"a no-brainer to pick up the sequel.\" Ah, a critic who loves romance and doesn't need any more convincing! On the other hand, God is a Geek was a bit more lukewarm, saying it's hard for newcomers to jump in without playing the original. Okay, got it!<br><br>Now, Cubed3 came along and gave Sweet and Spicy Darling a 90% score, praising its \"balanced backstory telling\" and \"wildly different plot routes.\" Someone who loves a good romance novel! Digitally Downloaded also scored it 90%, saying it's an \"artfully unique\" otome visual novel that's a must-play.<br><br>But then, Gamer Escape came along and brought the whole party down with its 60% score. They thought it should have been DLC, lacking in world-building and character development. Oops, looks like someone got left at the altar!<br><br>Tech-Gaming scored it 81%, saying you need to play the original first (no duh!), but it's still an entertaining romance fest. GLHF on Sports Illustrated, however, went a bit darker, scoring it 60% and saying it was all over the place, mixing genres and names like Greek and Roman gods. Um, maybe they just didn't get the memo that this is a rom-com!<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, as a self-proclaimed romantic at heart, I think Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling is a delightful sequel that will charm your socks off! The critics are right â€“ it's all about the romance, drama, and sweetness. If you're a fan of otome visual novels or just love a good love story, this game is for you!<br><br>Now, go forth and spread the love (and Cupid's arrows) in the world of Cupid Parasite: Sweet and Spicy Darling!",
