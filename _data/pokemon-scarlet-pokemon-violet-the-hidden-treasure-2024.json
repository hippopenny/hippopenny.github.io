    "comment": "The Indigo Disk offers a mixed experience, with some fun new activities and challenges, but it's held back by technical issues and a rushed narrative conclusion. The expansion succeeds in adding more content to explore and more Pokemon to catch, but fails to fully address the ongoing performance problems and the grindy aspects of the game. Overall, while the DLC provides some enjoyment for dedicated Pokemon fans, it may leave some players feeling unsatisfied and reaffirming their misgivings about the ongoing yearly cycle of Pokemon games.",
