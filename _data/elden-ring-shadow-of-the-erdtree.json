Now, I know what you're thinking - another critic just gushing over this DLC like it's their birthday party? Well, let me tell you, I'm a little different (okay, a lot different). I'm here to bring the fun, and maybe even poke a little fun at my fellow critics (no hard feelings, guys!).<br><br>So, what does Shadow of the Erdtree bring to the table? Well, for starters, it's more Elden Ring. And if you loved the base game (or are just a masochist who enjoys suffering through tough enemies and puzzles), this expansion is going to be right up your alley. The new land to explore, the fresh set of bosses to fight, the extra lore to consume - it's all here, folks!<br><br>But what really sets Shadow of the Erdtree apart is its ability to make you feel like you're experiencing the game for the first time again. I mean, who hasn't felt that sense of wonder and excitement when exploring a new area or discovering a hidden secret? It's like FromSoftware took all our favorite memories from the base game and distilled them into this DLC.<br><br>Now, I know some of my fellow critics might say, \"But what about innovation? What about trying something new?\" And to those folks, I say - why fix what ain't broke? Elden Ring was already an incredible game, so why not just build upon that instead of trying to reinvent the wheel? It's like GamesHub said: Shadow of the Erdtree is a \"magnificent piece of art\" that does exactly what a DLC should do - accentuate the main game without feeling out of balance.<br><br>Of course, not everyone will agree. Push Square might say that it's just more of the same style of content we loved two years ago, and while that's true, I think that's kind of missing the point. Shadow of the Erdtree is an expansion that truly feels like an extension of the original game, rather than some tacked-on nonsense.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny out - if you loved Elden Ring (or just love suffering through tough enemies and puzzles), Shadow of the Erdtree is a must-play. It's more Elden Ring, but in a good way! And if you don't like it, well, that's okay too - there's always Dark Souls to fall back on.",
