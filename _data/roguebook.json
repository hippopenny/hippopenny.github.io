    "comment": "Roguebook is a delightful blend of strategy and card gameplay, offering a fresh take on the deck-building genre. The positional combat puzzle adds a unique twist to the gameplay, allowing players to experiment with unexpected combinations of hero abilities. While the two-hero system may feel less focused at times, the game's new ideas and well-crafted world make it well worth a look. However, players should be aware of potential game-breaking bugs that may affect the overall experience.",
