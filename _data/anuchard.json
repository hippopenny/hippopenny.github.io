    "comment": "Anuchard delivers a colorful and charming action RPG experience with a fair share of fun and repetition. The game's quirky mix of city building, dungeon crawling, and puzzle-solving may feel a bit mired in the past, but it still manages to provide a hearty indie adventure with boss battles and cooking that will keep players ring-a-ding-dinging.",
