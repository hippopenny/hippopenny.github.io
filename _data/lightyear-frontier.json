    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier offers a charming farming and crafting experience set in a sci-fi world, where you pilot a stompy robot suit to explore and restore the land. While the game may start slow and lacks a robust story, its tranquil and nature-focused gameplay, along with stunning visuals, make it an enjoyable choice for relaxation and cooperative play. The promise of future updates adds to the potential of this early-access gem.",
