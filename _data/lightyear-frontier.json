    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier is a charming, non-violent farming and crafting game set in a sci-fi world, offering a relaxing experience with a touch of mystery. While some may find the lack of conflict and survival elements unusual, the game's focus on harmony with nature and its engaging multiplayer option make it a worthwhile journey. The visuals are gorgeous, and with promised updates, Lightyear Frontier has the potential to become the cooperative game of your dreams. So, if you're looking for a tranquil escape from the daily grind, hop into your big ol' stompy robot suit and embrace the cosmic bliss of Lightyear Frontier.",
