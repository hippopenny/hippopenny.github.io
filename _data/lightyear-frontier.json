    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier offers a refreshing take on the farming and crafting genre by blending it with sci-fi elements and a non-violent approach. The game encourages players to live in harmony with nature while exploring a charming world and unraveling the mystery of an ancient civilization. While the early access version lacks a compelling story and may feel slow at times, the game's potential for cooperative play and future updates makes it worth checking out. Get ready to stomp around in your big ol' robot suit and build, explore, and unwind in this steady little farming sim with a touch of sci-fi.",
