    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier offers a charming and relaxing farming and crafting experience in a sci-fi setting. While it may feel a bit slow at times and lacks some depth in storytelling, the game's focus on exploration and building makes it a delightful choice for unwinding after a long day. The cooperative multiplayer option adds potential for shared enjoyment with friends. With a promising roadmap for future updates and a cozy atmosphere, Lightyear Frontier is a gem worth keeping an eye on.",
