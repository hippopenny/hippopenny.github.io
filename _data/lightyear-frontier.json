    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier takes the familiar farming and crafting genre and adds a delightful sci-fi twist with stompy robot suits. The early access version may have some rough edges, but the engaging world and peaceful gameplay make it a charming experience. While some critics note the lack of conflict and survival elements, the game's emphasis on harmony with nature offers a refreshing change of pace. The co-op mode and planned updates also hold promise for the game's future. So, if you're ready to unwind in a tranquil yet futuristic world, Lightyear Frontier is certainly worth exploring.",
