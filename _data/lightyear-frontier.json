    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier offers a refreshing take on the farming and crafting genre by incorporating a sci-fi setting with a non-violent and nature-focused gameplay. The game's early access version provides a relaxing and visually appealing experience, allowing players to freely explore and build in a charming world. While the lack of story may be a drawback for some, the promise of future updates and the potential for cooperative play make it a game worth checking out. So, suit up, grab your friends, and get ready for a soothing journey through the stars!",
