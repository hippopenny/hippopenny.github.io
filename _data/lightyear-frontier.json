    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier is a charming, relaxing farming and crafting game set in a sci-fi world where you can explore, build, and grow without the constant threat of violent conflict. While the game starts slow and lacks a fully developed story, its nature-focused gameplay and gorgeous visuals offer a refreshing break from the usual survival games. With multiplayer mode and promised updates, Lightyear Frontier has the potential to become the cooperative game of our dreams.",
