    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier is a delightful escape into a sci-fi farming and crafting world. With its early access offering, the game presents a charming and steady experience, although it might feel a bit dated in comparison to other games in the genre. The game encourages harmony with nature and relaxation, allowing players to freely explore and unravel ancient mysteries while engaging in a bit of a grind for resources. The co-op mode with crossplay option adds an enticing social element, making it a promising prospect for a weekend activity with friends. Despite its current limitations and the need for future updates, Lightyear Frontier is already a comforting gaming experience. Plus, who doesn't want to roam around in a big ol' stompy robot suit?",
