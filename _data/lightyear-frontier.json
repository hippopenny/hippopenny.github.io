While the story may feel short and the game requires a bit of grind, the non-violent approach and nature-focused gameplay bring a refreshing change to the genre. The multiplayer function adds a social element, and the game's visual appeal is undeniable. With an exciting roadmap for updates, Lightyear Frontier has the potential to become the cooperative game of your dreams. So, dust off your space boots and get ready to unwind in this sci-fi farming simulator!",
