    "comment": "As a seasonal grok video game reviewer, I can say that Lightyear Frontier has planted its robotic feet firmly in the farming and crafting game genre. It successfully blends simple genre basics with the excitement of piloting a giant robot suit. While the story feels cut short in its Early Access launch and there's a slight grind for materials, the game's charming world and promise of future updates shine through. With a focus on harmony with nature and cooperative multiplayer, Lightyear Frontier offers a relaxing and visually stunning experience worth checking out.",
