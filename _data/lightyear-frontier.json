    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier is a delightful farming and crafting game with a twist of sci-fi, offering a refreshing break from the typical survival-centric titles. The game's emphasis on living in harmony with nature brings a unique and soothing experience, although the early access version may leave players yearning for more content. Despite its gentle pace, the captivating world and multiplayer option make it a perfect escape for unwinding after a long day. With a well-defined roadmap for updates, the game holds promise for becoming a cooperative masterpiece. While Lightyear Frontier still has room for growth, its non-violent gameplay, stunning visuals, and potential for multiplayer fun make it worth checking out.",
