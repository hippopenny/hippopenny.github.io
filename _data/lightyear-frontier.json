    "comment": "Lightyear Frontier offers a charming and relaxing farming experience with a touch of sci-fi, inviting players to explore and build in a non-violent, nature-focused setting. While it may start slow and lacks a fully fleshed-out story, its Early Access version already feels like a complete and comforting gaming experience. The game's well-defined roadmap for updates promises to transform it into the cooperative game of your dreams.",
