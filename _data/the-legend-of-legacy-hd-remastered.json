    "comment": "Dive into the dungeons of Avalon in The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered, a charming yet flawed journey filled with nostalgic nostalgia. Set your expectations right, as this game offers a decent dungeon-crawling experience with unique mechanics and stunning visuals, but beware of its lackluster narrative and repetitive nature. If you're a hardcore dungeon crawler enthusiast, this remastered version may quench your thirst for adventure, but for others, it might feel like a journey with an unsatisfactory conclusion.",
