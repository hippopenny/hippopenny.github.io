    "comment": "Grime is a dark and twisted delight that delivers a refreshing take on the Souls-inspired 2D Metroidvania genre. Its intricate world and finely-balanced combat provide an exhilarating experience, while the game's willingness to offer help instead of punishment sets it apart from traditional Souls-like games. The challenging bosses and imaginative enemies add to the thrill, making Grime a must-play for hardcore Metroidvania fans.",
