As we explore the game's reception among critics, keep in mind that opinions are like pizza crusts – they're all worth something, but some might be crumby.<br><br>Let's kick things off with Digitally Downloaded, who gave Visions of Mana a perfect 100 score. It's clear that this critic is a fan, as they lavish praise on the game's size, stating it has around 50-60 hours of content at a reasonable pace. That's a lot to chew on! While we're talking about a big game, it's worth noting that Visions of Mana might not be revolutionary like the classic Secret of Mana – but who knows? It could carve out its own niche as the purest definition of comfort gaming.<br><br>PSX Brasil (85/100) had an equally enthusiastic take, describing the experience as \"a comfortable game\" with a simple yet thought-provoking story that's well executed. When I read this review, I couldn't help but wonder if anyone would call pizza delivery \"comfort food.\"<br><br>IGN Italia (80/100) offers a slightly more measured assessment, calling Visions of Mana a \"commendable comeback for the series.\" This critic praises the game's story and gameplay as beautiful and captivating in their liveness. Not bad, Italy! Still trying to figure out why anyone would think pizza comes from Italy...<br><br>Moving on to the naysayers (yay, contrarians?), we have Wccftech (75/100), who found Visions of Mana fun but disappointing due to excessive backtracking and content padding. Talk about crunch time – this critic feels burned! For those playing at home, that's 25 points deducted from perfection.<br><br>Finally (or, I guess, \"finally\"), there are the reviewers on either end of the critical spectrum: Gamereactor UK (70/100) suggests Visions of Mana is short and not always great at being retro. Well, they're certainly right about it being Japanese... But what can you do? Not everyone will love your weird cousin game.<br><br>But Why Tho? (70/100) simplifies the experience to fit a classic brand while acknowledging that this approach might feel shallow. On the bright side, their review states that combat can be exhilarating when everything clicks into place! Just think of all the pizza orders you'll fulfill with those smooth combat moves...<br><br>GameSpot (50/100) pretty bluntly says it's time to lower your expectations if you're planning on playing Visions of Mana. Yikes! Well, this critic is right: there are hundreds of better RPGs out there to spend your time on... and pizza is available in a more delightful variety here",
