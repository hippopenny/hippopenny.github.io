We're diving into the world of tower defense and co-op madness with Dungeon Defenders.<br><br>Let me tell you, these critics are like a bunch of groks on speed (I'll get to that in a bit). They just can't get enough of this game! Even the tough ones, like GameSpot, who gave it a mere 65. Okay, maybe not \"tough\" as much as...grumpy. Like when I accidentally superglued my shoes to the floor during a gaming session and had to hop around like a hippo on roller skates (true story). Yeah, that grumpy.<br><br>But seriously, these reviews are all about the co-op experience. Even Official Xbox Magazine, those Xbox-loving folks, were raving about it! \"Habit-forming\" is their words, not mine (although I do have a habit of playing video games for hours on end...shh, don't tell my therapist).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the gameplay? Is it just a bunch of grunts and groans like those hippos in the background of my living room? Ha! No way. Dungeon Defenders is all about strategy and teamwork (or going solo if you're one of those \"gamer\" types, like Gaming Nexus said). It's fast-paced, colorful, and...well, you get the idea.<br><br>Gaming Age summed it up best: \"Dungeon Defenders is frantic, colorful and deep in a class of games that's usually just frantic and colorful.\" Yeah, that about covers it. I mean, who doesn't love a good tower defense game? It's like having a snack - satisfying, but also leaves you wanting more (like when I accidentally ate an entire bag of chips in one sitting...don't ask).<br><br>In the end, Dungeon Defenders is a standout title that'll keep you entertained for hours on end. And if you're playing with friends, even better! It's like having your own personal gaming party (minus the mess, the shouting matches over who ate the last bag of chips, and the inevitable \"Why did we play all night again?\").<br><br>So there you have it - a groovy review that's all about the fun. No scores, no fancy stats, just a good ol' fashioned love fest for Dungeon Defenders (and maybe a little bit of hip-hop humor on the side).",
