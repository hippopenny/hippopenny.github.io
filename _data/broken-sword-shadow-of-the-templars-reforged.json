It's your buddy \"Groak-ing\" Gary here, and I'm thrilled to dive into the world of point-and-click adventures with Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - Reforged. With a whopping 30-year history, this classic has still got it going on, and I'll dish out my two cents on why you should give it another spin (or multiple spins, if you're like me)!<br><br>First off, let's get to what the critics are croaking about: nostalgia. You know what they say - familiarity breeds contentment! For those who've been around since the early days of gaming, Reforged is a love letter to fans who've grown up with George and Nico (I mean, have you seen those mullets?). But don't worry; this remake ain't just for the old folks! The modernized visuals and engaging gameplay will hook newbloods without breaking a sweat.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Wait, didn't these critics just go ape over the original?\" To that, I say... yeah, they did! And rightfully so. Revolution Games (the brains behind Broken Sword) have accomplished something special here - a remake that honors its past while giving nostalgic fans new reasons to fall in love all over again.<br><br>Some of you might be thinking, \"Gary, isn't this just more of the same old-school stuff we saw 30 years ago?\" Ah, yes! And that's exactly the point. Reforged doesn't pretend to change the world; it takes what made Broken Sword great and updates it for today's audience. In short, if you loved the original (or missed out the first go 'round), Reforged is a masterclass in subtlety - upgrading familiar elements without sacrificing that special je ne sais quoi.<br><br>Oh, and don't get me started on George showing off his... ahem... \"famous\" greasepaint tissue trick. I mean, that's still got 'em giggling! In the words of our esteemed reviewer from TheGamer: \"Does this tissue mean anything to you?\" Heck yes, it does!<br><br>All right, folks, that's my take on Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - Reforged. If you're already a fan of point-and-click adventures or just looking for a great gaming experience, this one's an absolute must-play (or re-play, if you will). Don't @ me - trust Gary's gut: this timeless treasure is worth your time!",
