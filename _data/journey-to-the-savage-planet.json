    "comment": "Hippo Penny - and welcome to my review of Journey to the Savage Planet! I'm thrilled to dive into this quirky first-person exploration game, which has already captured the hearts of many critics. But don't worry, I won't just copy-paste their glowing reviews (although, let's be real, some of them are quite... colorful).<br><br>First off, let's get the serious business out of the way: Journey to the Savage Planet is an excellent game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. It's a masterclass in world-building, with a richly detailed and humorously absurd setting that'll have you giggling like a grok (see what I did there?). But what really sets it apart is its commitment to exploration and discovery.<br><br>As you delve deeper into the game's mysterious planet, you'll uncover secrets, encounter bizarre creatures, and stumble upon wacky contraptions. It's like playing Metroid Prime, but with better jokes and more... well, savagery. The combat system can be a bit wonky at times (I'm looking at you, Vandal!), but the game's lighthearted tone makes up for it.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the critics?\" Ah, yes! Let me take this opportunity to poke fun at some of my colleagues. PlayStation Country thinks Journey to the Savage Planet is excellent and often funny (yawn, surprise), while GamePro Germany says it's almost too colorful (what an absurd criticism!). Meanwhile, PlaySta... err, I mean, PlayStation Universe raves about its creative creature design and rewarding gameplay loop (okay, okay, they're not as biased as they seem).<br><br>The rest of the critics are a bit more mixed. Jeuxvideo.com thinks it shines but fails to bring the combat system into the formula (valid point!), while Telegraph calls it a blessing that it doesn't outstay its welcome (harsh, but fair). And then there's Slant Magazine, which says the game's themes feel like wallpaper over mechanics that feed into the ideas being critiqued (okay, that one's just weird).<br><br>In conclusion, Journey to the Savage Planet is an absolute blast. If you're looking for a lighthearted adventure with a dash of humor and exploration, look no further! Just don't expect me to give it a score - I'm far too busy making bad grok puns (see: \"Hippo Penny\").",
