Now, before you start thinking this is going to be another tedious review filled with jargon and over-analysis, let me assure you it won't be. Well, not too much anyway.<br><br>First off, I gotta give a shoutout to those fancy critics from places like VideoGamer and Twinfinite who seem to have an endless supply of glowing praise for Football Manager 24. Their scores are all in the high 80s and low 90s, so yeah, it's safe to say they loved it. But let's be real, what didn't they love? It's Football Manager!<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the changes?\" Well, friends, the good folks at Sports Interactive have added some minor innovations that'll make your eyes light up like a teenager on prom night. You get things like improved animation (GLHF on Sports Illustrated), new tactics, and an assistant manager who's less annoying than a certain critic I won't name (cough, VideoGamer, cough).<br><br>But let's not forget the old faithfuls - those pesky micromanagement enthusiasts who will still find ways to nitpick every little thing. Don't worry, they're taken care of too with things like assistant managers and match simulations. It's like having your own personal football genius at your beck and call.<br><br>In conclusion, Football Manager 24 is a game that checks all the right boxes. It's got its quirks, it's got its flaws, but most importantly, it's still Football Manager. So if you're a fan of the series or just looking for a new challenge, then this game is definitely worth a look.<br><br>P.S. I'll never understand why anyone would want to manage a team like Bolton Wanderers.",
