Get ready for a snappy review that's gonna make you wanna jump into the world of Children of the Sun!<br><br>First off, let me say that these critics are like trying to describe a unicorn's majesty - it's an uphill battle, folks! But I'll give 'em props for trying. IGN's 70 seems fair, but where was the love? GameSpot's 80 is spot on, though; this game is indeed a bloody delight! And don't even get me started on Game Informer's 90 - they nailed it!<br><br>Now, what about Slant Magazine's 70? Um... did they mean to say that Suda G≈çichi is taking notes (wink)? Vandal's 77 is kinda vague, but I'll give 'em points for being honest. And SpazioGames' 84? Bingo! They hit the target!<br><br>Okay, now let's dive into the game itself. Children of the Sun is like a puzzle-packed box of magic bullets - it's got brains and brawn in equal measure! You play as a sniping mastermind (or mess-er, depending on your skills), using magic shots to solve spatial problems. It's like a macabre game of Tetris... but with skulls, blood, and the occasional flying head! *crunch*<br><br>Seriously, though - it's an absolute blast, especially when you nail that perfect shot and watch your enemies go ka-BOOM! The levels are cleverly designed to make you think outside the box (or coffin), and those high-score runs? Forget about it; it's like trying to collect all the power-ups in a Mario game!<br><br>So here's the verdict: Children of the Sun is a snappy, supernatural shooter that'll keep you entertained for hours on end. Just don't say I didn't warn you...",
