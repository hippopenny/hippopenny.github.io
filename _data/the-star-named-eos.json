And why shouldn't I? After all, who else can make you laugh and cry (okay, maybe just laugh) while reviewing some of the best and worst games out there?<br><br>Now, about The Star Named EOS... This little gem has been getting rave reviews from critics like Press Start Australia, Push Square, KeenGamer, GameSpew, and SpazioGames. And I'm here to tell you that they're not wrong! This game is a masterpiece, folks!<br><br>First of all, the story is bittersweet (or should I say \"bittersweet-iful\"?). It's like a beautiful poem, but instead of words, it's told through point-and-click puzzling and some light photography. And let me tell you, it's an absolute treat! The artwork is hand-drawn and stunning, making the game feel like a living, breathing work of art.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the gameplay?\" Ah, my friends, the gameplay is where this game really shines! It's like a puzzle-lover's dream come true. You'll be solving all sorts of brain-teasers and unraveling mysteries in no time. And if that's not enough, there are also some amazing photographic moments to look forward to.<br><br>But what about the length, you ask? Well, let me tell you, this game is bite-sized! It's like a nice little snack to keep your taste buds going. And at almost $15, I think it's well worth the price.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a game that will capture your heart and mind (and maybe even make you laugh), then The Star Named EOS is the game for you!<br><br>P.S. Don't forget to check out the other reviews from those big-name critics like MeuPlayStation... they might not be as funny as mine, but hey, someone's gotta keep things real!",
