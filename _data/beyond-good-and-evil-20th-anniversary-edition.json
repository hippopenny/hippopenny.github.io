As a seasoned grok video game reviewer with a taste for adventure (and a pinch of humor), I dove headfirst into Jade's iconic escapades to see if this classic still holds up.<br><br>I won't lie; some critics are having their cake and eating it too - \"The game may show its age at times...\" Oh, really? Tell me something I didn't know! (Cue TheSixthAxis' review) But hey, even the most seasoned of reviewers can get a little carried away with themselves. After all, we're talking about a game that's 20 years old - it's like trying to date a grandparent!<br><br>Hobby Consolas wisely pointed out that this remaster is an opportunity for new fans to experience Beyond Good & Evil, and I couldn't agree more! It's like introducing your kids to their grandparents; they'll get the whole \"back in my day...\" vibe, but with better graphics and controls.<br><br>Eurogamer Portugal had some lovely things to say about Ubisoft's effort to present this cult classic in its best possible light. And honestly, it shows - this game still has charm and character oozing out of every pixel! A commendable effort indeed!<br><br>Push Square's review got me all warm and fuzzy inside with their praise for the remastered musical score and supplemental materials. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned nostalgia trip?<br><br>PSX Brasil went full-on nostalgic mode (sorry, not sorry), praising the game's ability to weather the test of time like a fine wine... or a grandparent's wisdom.<br><br>Metro GameCentral was more measured in their approach, acknowledging that while this is a well-crafted tribute, it can't hide the foibles of a 20-year-old game. Spoiler alert: sometimes we just gotta let our hair down and enjoy the ride!<br><br>GLHF on Sports Illustrated (because who doesn't love a good acronym?) brought up some valid points about the dated aspects of the game - I mean, who didn't waste money thinking those \"upgrades\" were actual upgrades? Ah, memories!<br><br>All in all, Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is an enjoyable adventure that still holds up today. It's like revisiting your grandparents' old photo album, only to realize how much you've grown (or shrunk). <br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play some more Beyond Good & Evil and pretend I'm a 20-something again... or at least until I spill something on my shirt.",
