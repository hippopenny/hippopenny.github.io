    "comment": "Arzette The Jewel of Faramore is like a nostalgic blast from the past, embracing the quirky charm of the CD-i Zelda games. It offers a fun and straightforward platforming experience, but be warned, it's all about that retro flavor. With cheeky cutscenes and side-quests galore, this game is a weekend delight for those in on the joke. However, for the uninitiated, it may not hold the same magic. Overall, it's a loving homage that captures the essence of its inspiration but falls slightly short in terms of lasting impact.",
