With its unique real-time typing mechanics and black-and-white pencil-sketch visuals, Cryptmaster has piqued my interest. But what do the critics think? Well, let me tell you - it's a mixed bag out there!<br><br>Slant Magazine gave Cryptmaster 50, saying it's \"frustrating\" but at least trying to be original (ouch!). They appreciated the visual style and homage to Wizardry, though. On the other hand, Hardcore Gamer thought it was \"commendable\" and praised its \"originality in gameplay and narrative\". They did mention some technical issues, but overall, it's an engaging game.<br><br>RPG Fan gave Cryptmaster a solid 85, saying it's a game that does what it sets out to do capably. They liked the constant changes in gameplay and thought it was great for vocabulary enthusiasts (word nerds unite!). Softpedia also gave it 85, praising its world-building, presentation, and innovative mechanic. Combat can be a chore sometimes, but hey, bug sounds are always fun!<br><br>Movies Games and Tech was less enthusiastic with their 60 score. While they thought Cryptmaster is unique and well-functioning, they didn't find the story or pacing up to par.<br><br>But then there's Press Start Australia, which gave it a whopping 90! They called it a \"wickedly clever\" spin on edutainment games and praised its humor and eccentrics (including our titular Cryptmaster).<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, it seems like Cryptmaster is a game that will either delight you with its originality or frustrate you with its technical issues. As for me? I'm just here to have fun and make witty remarks! If you're up for a challenge that combines language skills and typing speed, Cryptmaster might be the game for you. But don't say I didn't warn you...",
