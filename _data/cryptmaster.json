Today, we're talking about Cryptmaster, an indie game that's got everyone from Slant Magazine to Press Start Australia singing its praises.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What's the big deal about typing games?\" Well, my friends, let me tell you - Cryptmaster is no ordinary typing game. It's like a love child between Wizardry and Words with Friends, but instead of just trying to get your high score or beat your friend, you're actually navigating through an underworld full of cryptic clues, creepy crawlies, and... wait for it... CRYPTS!<br><br>Yes, you heard that right - Cryptmaster is all about exploring an ancient underground realm by solving puzzles, typing out cryptic messages, and making friends (or foes) along the way. It's like a Choose Your Own Adventure book, but instead of just reading, you're actively participating in the story.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Let's see what some of the other critics have to say:<br><br>* Slant Magazine says: \"Frustrating as the game may be, the real-time typing is at least trying to be original, and the visuals, with their detailed black-and-white pencil-sketching succeed both as an homage and modernization of the wireframe environments of Wizardry.\" Yeah, yeah - we get it. You guys like it because it's \"original\" (wink-wink).<br>* Hardcore Gamer gives it an 80: \"Cryptmaster is a commendable indie game that stands out for its originality in gameplay and narrative... The game will challenge your linguistic and typing skills and pull you deep into its mysterious world, promising adventure and amusement.\" Oh, wow - I'm impressed. You actually used the words \"commendable\" and \"originality\".<br>* RPG Fan gives it an 85: \"Cryptmaster does what it sets out to do capably... If words are your thing, I cannot think of a single game that does what this game does better.\" Ahahah - nice one! You're saying we language lovers have finally found our happy place.<br>* Softpedia gives it an 85: \"World-building is pretty good, and the presentation adds to it with its striking black-and-white... Only the combat can sometimes feel like a chore...\" Ouch - nice burn, Softpedia! We all know what you're really saying: \"Combat? Who needs combat when you have WORDS?! \"<br><br>And finally, Press Start Australia gives it a glowing 90: \"Cryptmaster is a wickedly clever spin on the edutainment games of old... Spread the word, Cryptmaster is a must-play indie.\" Yessss - we agree! This game is the real deal!<br><br>So there you have it, folks - Cryptmaster might not be everyone's cup of tea (okay, maybe it will), but for us language lovers and fans of quirky indie games, this one's a real winner. Give it a try and see if you can unravel its cryptic secrets!",
