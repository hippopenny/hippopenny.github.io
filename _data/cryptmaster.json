It's your boy, back with another review that's guaranteed to make you laugh, cry, and possibly type out a few sentences faster than usual.<br><br>Let's get this over with – I'm reviewing Cryptmaster, an indie game that's got everyone talking (or should I say, typing?). It's a dungeon crawler like no other, where instead of swinging swords or casting spells, you'll be using your linguistic skills to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Yes, you read that right – it's all about the words, baby!<br><br>Now, let's see what the \"experts\" have to say. Slant Magazine thinks it's frustrating at times (yawn), while Hardcore Gamer praises its originality and engaging plot. RPG Fan loves how the gameplay always changes, and Softpedia thinks it's a perfect example of an indie title with a strong innovative mechanic. Meanwhile, Movies Games and Tech says it's unique and well-functioning, but lacks a breathtaking story. And Press Start Australia? They're just having too much fun calling it \"wickedly clever\" and \"a must-play indie.\"<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, Hippo Penny is all about the fun, baby! Cryptmaster has got some of the most entertaining side characters I've ever seen in a game. The world-building is top-notch, and those visuals – oh boy, they're like nothing you've ever seen before! It's like someone took all the Wireframe environments from Wizardry, threw in some black-and-white pencil sketches, and said, \"Hey, let's make something special!\"<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the gameplay?\" Ah, my friends, that's where things get a little crazy. It's not just about typing out words fast – it's an actual puzzle game. You'll need to use your brain (and those linguistic skills) to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. And let me tell you, it can get pretty challenging! But hey, that's what makes it so rewarding when you finally beat that tricky level.<br><br>In conclusion, Cryptmaster is a must-play indie game that will challenge your typing skills, puzzle-solving abilities, and even your sense of humor. So, if you're looking for something new and exciting to play, look no further! (Just don't expect me to type out any five-star reviews – my fingers are still recovering from all the typing I did while playing this game).",
