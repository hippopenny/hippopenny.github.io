As I dived into this underground adventure, I found myself getting tangled up in the game's world-building and witty wordplay. But don't just take my word for it – let's see what some of our esteemed critics have to say.<br><br>First off, Slant Magazine thinks Cryptmaster is \"frustrating,\" but hey, who doesn't love a good challenge? And I'm with them on the visuals; those black-and-white pencil sketches are a masterclass in evoking atmosphere. Wizardry vibes, anyone?<br><br>Now, Hardcore Gamer's got a different take – they praise the game for its originality and narrative! They're right; Cryptmaster does offer a fresh perspective on dungeon crawling. And who can resist those engaging side characters? The only minor quibble is control responsiveness, but hey, we've all been there with finicky controls.<br><br>RPG Fan's review is a bit more laid-back – they think Cryptmaster does what it sets out to do capably. I mean, who doesn't love a good vocabulary-based romp? And it's true; thoughtful play really makes the game shine! (Just don't expect a frenetic typing fest.)<br><br>Sofpedia's take is all about that combat, though – they think it can sometimes feel like a chore. I get what they mean; those long-enemy names do start to get on your nerves after a while! On the other hand, the world-building and presentation are top-notch.<br><br>Finally, Press Start Australia gives Cryptmaster a glowing review – they call it \"wickedly clever\"! And who can blame 'em? That underworld full of gallows humor and eccentrics is a real treat!<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny, I'm going to give you my two cents: Cryptmaster is an absolute blast! It's all about the typing, baby! (Don't worry; it's not just for speedrunners.) With its innovative mechanics, engaging story, and wacky world-building, this indie title has earned its place on my list of must-plays. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some words to type...",
