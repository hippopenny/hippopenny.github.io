I'm back to give you the lowdown on Cryptmaster, a game that will put your typing skills to the test and have you groaning at some of the worst puns in gaming. Kidding aside, let's dive into the nitty-gritty.<br><br>First off, let's tackle the elephant in the room – or rather, the crypt-keeper. Critics are divided on this one, with Slant Magazine giving it a 50 and calling it \"frustrating\" (ouch!). But Hardcore Gamer and RPG Fan saw something special, with scores of 80 and 85 respectively. So, what's the verdict? Well, I'm here to give you my two cents.<br><br>Cryptmaster is an indie game that's all about typing. Yes, you read that right – typing! You'll be tapping away at your keyboard like a mad person as you navigate the game's mysterious underworld. It's not just about speed, though; this game requires strategy and patience, too. The combat can get a bit repetitive (Softpedia's 85-rated review mentioned it), but when you're on a roll, it's hard to stop.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – \"Is this game for me?\" If you love typing games or are looking for something unique, then Cryptmaster is worth checking out. The presentation is top-notch, with striking black-and-white visuals that'll transport you to a world of ancient crypts and mysterious artifacts. And let's not forget the humor! There are some cringe-worthy puns in there (okay, maybe they're just groan-inducing for me).<br><br>In conclusion, Cryptmaster is a game that will challenge your typing skills and keep you entertained with its clever mechanics and quirky characters. So, if you're looking for something outside the ordinary dungeon crawler experience, give this one a shot.<br><br>Oh, and by the way, I'm not saying my review is as good as Press Start Australia's 90-rated masterpiece (although, let me tell you, it's no easy feat to come up with puns that rival theirs). But hey, at least I didn't compare myself to Movies Games and Tech's... well, let's just say their 60-rated review didn't exactly inspire confidence.",
