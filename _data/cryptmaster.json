Here's my review of Cryptmaster, because I just can't get enough of typing out phrases like \"Gollum loves his precious\" in a dungeon crawler.<br><br>Now, let me get this out of the way - I'm no hardcore gamer. In fact, my gaming skills are so rusty, I make a grok look like a pro player. But hey, that's what makes Cryptmaster so refreshing! It's not just another click-fest with flashy graphics and mindless action. No sir, it's all about the words, baby!<br><br>Slant Magazine says Cryptmaster is \"frustrating\" - oh boy, I love being frustrated while playing a game! But in all seriousness, their comment highlights what makes this game so special: its unique blend of real-time typing and dungeon crawling. And those black-and-white visuals? Stunning!<br><br>Hardcore Gamer gives it an 80, praising the game's originality and entertaining side characters. I mean, who wouldn't want to hang out with a crypt-keeper that looks like a cross between Nosferatu and a library card catalog?<br><br>RPG Fan says Cryptmaster is \"capable\" - now, I know what you're thinking: capable of what? Well, it's capable of making you feel like a total word nerd! Monotony never strikes because the gameplay always changes (albeit vocabulary-based). Patient players will thrive in this game.<br><br>Softpedia says combat can sometimes feel like a chore - yep, those long enemy names do get tiresome. But hey, listening for bug sounds is half the fun!<br><br>And Press Start Australia? They think Cryptmaster is \"wickedly clever\" - I mean, who wouldn't want to play an indie game that combines typing with gallows humor and eccentrics?<br><br>In conclusion, if you're ready to tap out some words, explore a mysterious underworld, and have a blast doing it, then Cryptmaster is the game for you! Just don't expect me to beat my high score anytime soon - Hippo Penny's got some serious catching up to do.",
