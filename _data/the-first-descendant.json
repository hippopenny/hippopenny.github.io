PC Games thought it was just \"mediocre\" with some nice ideas and fun gunplay, but ultimately brought down by boring storylines and poor performance. Destructoid was all over the place (pun intended), calling it a mix of good and bad parts that don't quite come together. Eurogamer summed it up nicely - neither great nor terrible, just... meh.<br><br>Now, on to my take!<br><br>In The First Descendant, you play as one of those cool descendant characters with special abilities. And yeah, the gunplay is fun! You get to run around, shoot stuff, and feel like a boss (see what I did there?). But here's the thing: the rest of the game doesn't quite live up to that initial excitement.<br><br>Don't get me wrong - it's not all bad. The buildcrafting system is kinda cool, and the cooperative aspects are... well, cooperative! You get to play with friends, share your loot, and work together to take down baddies. It's like a big ol' team effort!<br><br>BUT (and there's always a but, right?), those strengths get bogged down by some serious weaknesses. Like, have you seen the story? It's like... zzz... where was I going with this?<br><br>Okay, okay, I'll stop. Seriously though, if you're looking for a fun looter shooter to play with your pals, The First Descendant might be worth a try. Just don't expect too much from the single-player experience (yawn).<br><br>There you have it - my take on The First Descendant! It's not a masterpiece by any means, but hey, at least it tries. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some other games to review... or maybe just play for fun .",
