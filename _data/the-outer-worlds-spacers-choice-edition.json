    "comment": "The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition brings some welcome improvements and additional content, but falls short in performance and technical issues. The updated visuals and bundled DLC offer a fresh experience, but returning players may feel left out in the cold. With potential for patches and fixes, the Spacer�s Choice Edition is a solid choice for new players on next-gen platforms.",
