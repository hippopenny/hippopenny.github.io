    "comment": "Nour: Play With Your Food lets you indulge in a delightful culinary playground, but its flavors may leave you craving for more substance. The game offers a quick, satisfying experience with its creative use of the DualSense controller and captivating visuals, but its replay value falls short like an appetizer that leaves you wanting a heartier main course. While the interactive art and playful soundtrack set an inviting tone, the gameplay loop lacks the depth to sustain long-term engagement. It's like a beautifully presented dish that lacks the depth of flavor to truly satisfy. Perhaps worth a taste for its novelty, but don't expect a feast.",
