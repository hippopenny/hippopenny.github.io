This action-packed sequel to the original game has taken everything great about the first one and turned it up a notch (or several). Gunfire Games has outdone themselves, delivering a game that's as challenging as it is engaging.<br><br>Let's get this out of the way - Remnant 2 is not perfect. But what is? Even the top critics have their gripes, from God is a Geek's \"a few shortcomings\" to PC Invasion's complaints about character mechanics and visuals. Heck, I'm a reviewer too, and even I had some moments where I thought, \"Hmm, maybe this isn't so great...\" <br><br>BUT WAIT, there's more! The game has got so many things right that it's easy to forget those minor issues. Shacknews sums it up best: Remnant 2 is \"a marked improvement over the first game\" with action, loot, and bosses that are simply over-the-top (in a good way). The addition of cooperative play only adds to the fun - imagine exploring beautiful environments and taking down deadly bosses with your squad!<br><br>GamingTrend agrees, stating that Remnant 2 is \"a no brainer must play\" for anyone who enjoyed the first game or just wants some serious gunplay. And even Gamereactor UK's criticism about it being more of the same only means that if you loved the original, you'll love this one even more!<br><br>XGN's review highlights the game's solid gunplay and exploration mechanics, despite a few flaws like fluctuating difficulty and weapon scarcity.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the negative reviews? Well, let me tell you, PC Invasion might have had some issues with character mechanics and visuals, but they still gave Remnant 2 credit for its replay value and dynamic generation feature. That's what matters to me!<br><br>In conclusion, Remant 2 is a game that will keep you on your toes (and maybe even make you shout \"Hippo Penny!\" in excitement). It may not be perfect, but it's definitely worth your time.<br><br>Stay groovy, gamers!",
