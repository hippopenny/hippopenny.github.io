    "comment": "Close to the Sun takes you on a visually stunning, slow-paced adventure through a tense and harrowing world reminiscent of BioShock and Outlast. While the atmosphere and storytelling shine, the sometimes-obtuse puzzles and repetitive chase sequences may dim the experience for some players. The lack of combat is a daring choice, but it may leave some wanting more. Overall, this is a captivating journey that falls just short of reaching its full potential.",
