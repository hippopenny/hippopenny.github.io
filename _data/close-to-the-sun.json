    "comment": "Close to the Sun is a visually stunning walking simulator that falls short in gameplay and storytelling. While it successfully creates a harrowing atmosphere reminiscent of BioShock and Outlast, the slow pacing, simple puzzles, and repetitive chase sequences detract from the overall experience. The lack of combat is an interesting choice but may leave players wanting more. Despite its flaws, the world-building and atmosphere are commendable, making it a decent narrative adventure for those who prioritize visuals and atmosphere over gameplay innovation.",
