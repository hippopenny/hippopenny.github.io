    "comment": "Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles offers a refreshing take on the city-building and strategy genre. Its simplicity in building mechanics and unique environment provide a cool and unusual experience. The game successfully simplifies traditional 4X mechanics, but the combat could use more attention to avoid feeling like an afterthought. The Freebuild Mode feels great, and the creative approach makes it stand out. However, the campaign scenarios may lack clear, actionable goals. Overall, it's a game that may either really click for you or leave you frustrated, but it's worth trying for its innovative approach.",
