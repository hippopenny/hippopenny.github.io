    "comment": "Stray Blade is a promising attempt at revamping the soulslike genre with its colorful world and potential combat system. However, the sluggish and imprecise gameplay mechanics hold it back from reaching its full potential. While it occasionally shows glimpses of creativity and effort, the overall lack of polish and balance detract from the experience. But hey, if you live and breathe ARPGs, and need to play each and every one of them, then perhaps Stray Blade is worth a shot.",
