Who wouldn't want a Soulslike game with a colorful art style and a focus on storytelling? Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was short-lived.<br><br>Now, before we get into the nitty-gritty, let me just say that I'm not exactly the most seasoned gamer (pun intended). But hey, that's what makes this review so refreshing - no pretentious critic-speak or trying to sound like a gaming expert. Just me, being my awesome self and sharing my thoughts on Stray Blade.<br><br>So, what didn't quite live up to its potential? Well, for starters, the combat mechanics left me feeling... sluggish (see what I did there?). It's as if Point Blank was going for that Soulslike \"tough-but-rewarding\" feel and ended up with a game that just feels clunky. And don't even get me started on the dodges, parries, and rolls - they're supposed to be flashy and smooth, but in Stray Blade, they're more like... well, let's just say I'm still trying to perfect my dodging skills.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But [Your Name], what about the story?\" And honestly? It's not bad. The art style is gorgeous, and the level design is top-notch. But (you knew this was coming), the narrative feels a bit... opaque (hey, at least someone else agrees - shoutout to IGN!). I mean, I loved the dynamic open world, but sometimes it felt like I was just running around trying to find my next clue.<br><br>So, what do the other critics think? Well, it looks like Stray Blade got a mixed bag of reviews. Some folks loved the game's art and level design (SpazioGames, The Games Machine), while others were less impressed with the combat mechanics (IGN, COGconnected). And then there are those who just plain didn't get what they expected (GameStar).<br><br>In conclusion? Stray Blade has its moments, but it's not exactly a standout game in the Soulslike department. If you're looking for something that'll challenge you and keep you engaged, you might want to look elsewhere (Elden Ring, anyone?). But hey, if you're willing to overlook some of the game's... let's call them \"growing pains,\" there's definitely potential here.<br><br>That's it for this review - thanks for sticking with me, folks!",
