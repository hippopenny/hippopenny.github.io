Let me tell you, I've got high hopes for this one - after all, who doesn't love a good challenge? But before we dive in, let's take a peek at what the other critics have been saying.<br><br>IGN is like the grumpy old uncle of the gaming world, always complaining about how things could be better. They gave Stray Blade a paltry 50, saying it \"tries and fails\" to bring something new to the table. Boo!<br><br>SpazioGames was more optimistic, giving it a 70 and saying it's got an \"fascinating story\" and \"dynamic open world.\" But hey, you've got to get past those pesky technical limitations first. Priorities, people!<br><br>COGconnected is like the cool aunt of gaming - always trying to find the good in things. They gave Stray Blade a 68, saying it's got some great art and level design, but the combat just doesn't quite work. Better luck next time, guys!<br><br>IGN Italia is like the optimistic cousin who thinks everyone's doing their best. They gave Stray Blade a 67, saying it tries to revamp the Soulslike formula but doesn't quite pull it off. Close, but no cigar!<br><br>GameStar is like the harsh critic who loves to tear things apart (literally). They gave Stray Blade a 59, saying it wants too much and fails to deliver. Yeah, yeah, yeah - we get it, GameStar.<br><br>The Games Machine is like the cool cat of gaming, always laid-back and never too hot or too cold. They gave Stray Blade a 70, saying it shows glimpses of effort but lacks polish. You can't win 'em all, folks!<br><br>Wccftech is like the grumpy old gamer who just wants to play something good without any fuss. They gave Stray Blade a 60, saying it's not terrible but not great either. ARPGs only for true fans of the genre, apparently.<br><br>Now that we've got the other critics out of the way, let's get to my own review! I'm going to dive in and see what kind of magic (or lack thereof) Stray Blade has cooking.<br><br>Stray Blade is an action RPG that tries to bring something new to the table - a dynamic open world, polished storytelling, and close-knit protagonists. And you know what? It actually kinda works!<br><br>The art design is stunning, with vibrant colors and clever level layouts. You can get lost in this game (and I mean that in the best possible way). The combat's got some nice ideas, but it takes a few tries to get the hang of it. And when you do, it's like a dance - dodges, parries, and rolls all come together in a beautiful sequence.<br><br>But here's the thing: Stray Blade is no Elden Ring (although, let's be real, what game is?). It's not going to blow your mind or change the gaming world overnight. It's just trying to have some fun and give you that same Soulslike feeling without being too dark or grimy.<br><br>So if you're an ARPG fan looking for something new and exciting, Stray Blade might be the ticket. Just don't expect it to revolutionize the genre - it's more of a gentle nudge in the right direction.<br><br>That's my two cents on Stray Blade! What do you think? Will you be giving this game a try or sticking with what you know and love?<br><br>Hippo Penny, signing off!",
