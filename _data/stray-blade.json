Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What's a Soulslike game without some serious darkness and existential dread?\" Well, buckle up, friend, because this one's all about... (drumroll) ...light!<br><br>That's right, folks! Stray Blade is all about shining bright in the world of action RPGs. And, honestly, I'm here for it. But don't get me wrong; our friends at IGN weren't exactly thrilled with their 50% score. They called it a \" Soulslike game that tries and fails to free itself from gloomy settings and opaque storytelling.\" Ouch!<br><br>Now, SpazioGames gave Stray Blade a solid 70%, praising its fascinating story and dynamic open world. But they had some major beef with the tech issues and gameplay limitations. Meanwhile, COGconnected scored it at 68, saying the mechanics just didn't quite live up to their potential.<br><br>The Italian contingent at IGN Italia also checked in at 67, feeling like Stray Blade didn't quite deliver on its promise of a polished narrative and combat system. And GameStar? Yeah, they weren't having it, giving Stray Blade a paltry 59%. Their review basically boiled down to: \"Play Elden Ring again instead.\"<br><br>Now, The Games Machine chimed in at 70, acknowledging that Point Blank put some effort into this game, but it just didn't quite come together. And Wccftech? They gave it a 60, saying it wasn't terrible, but the clunky execution made it hard to recommend.<br><br>So, where do I stand on this whole ordeal? Well, as your trusty groovy critic, I'll tell you: Stray Blade's got some great ideas, and if they can iron out those technical issues and polish up the combat, we might have a winner! Until then, it's all about finding that light in the darkness.<br><br>Stay tuned for more of my hilarious reviews, where I poke fun at myself and other critics (just kidding, sort of). See you next time, friends!",
