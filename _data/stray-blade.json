    "comment": "Hippo Penny! It's your boy here, reviewing Stray Blade, an action RPG that's trying to make a name for itself in the Soulslike genre. Now, I know what you're thinking - what makes this game stand out from all the others? Well, let me tell you, it's like trying to find the perfect slice of pizza (not a bad thing, by the way). You gotta sift through the toppings, get past the sauce, and find that sweet spot where everything comes together. And honestly, Stray Blade is still searching for its signature flavor.<br><br>First off, let's talk about the positives. The art style is vibrant, like a color-coded dream come true. The level design is top-notch, with a sense of exploration and discovery that keeps you engaged. It's got all the right ingredients, if you will. But, just like an overcooked pizza, it can get a bit messy.<br><br>Now, let's talk about the critics (wink). IGN says Stray Blade \"tries and fails\" - yeah, no kidding! It's like trying to make a perfect souffl√© without following the recipe. SpazioGames gives it 70 points, saying it's got an \"fascinating story,\" but needs work on the tech and gameplay. COGconnected is all about the mechanics being sluggish and imprecise, kinda like when your pizza delivery guy shows up late (don't worry, it happens!). IGN Italia says Stray Blade had some good intentions, but didn't quite deliver. GameStar straight-up tells you to play Elden Ring again - talk about a harsh critic! The Games Machine thinks it shows glimpses of effort, but lacks polish and balance. Wccftech... well, let's just say they're not too excited about Stray Blade either.<br><br>As for me? Well, I think Stray Blade is like that one friend who tries really hard to be cool, but ends up looking a bit awkward. It's not the worst game in the world (far from it!), but it needs some tweaking - maybe a few tweaks here and there, like adding more cheese (or fixing those dodgy mechanics). The potential is there; we just need to find that sweet spot where everything clicks into place.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I'm not gonna give you a score or anything (shh, don't tell anyone!). What I will say is that Stray Blade needs some work. It's got its moments of brilliance, but it also has those awkward slices. If you're an action RPG fan, you might still find something to enjoy here. And hey, who knows? Maybe with a bit more polish and some quality control, Stray Blade will become the next big thing!",
