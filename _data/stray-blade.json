    "comment": "Stray Blade is a valiant effort to inject new life into the Soulslike genre, but its execution falls short of its ambitious goals. The game's dynamic open world and promising combat system are marred by technical and gameplay limitations, making it a tough sell for casual players. While the attractive art and level design offer moments of enjoyment, the clunky mechanics and lack of polish hinder the overall experience. Despite its potential, Stray Blade struggles to deliver a satisfying gameplay experience, leaving players longing for the polished combat of titles like Elden Ring.",
