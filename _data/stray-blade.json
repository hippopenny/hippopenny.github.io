    "comment": "Stray Blade offers a tantalizing mix of narrative and combat potential, but falls short due to clunky mechanics and lack of polish. While the open world and story are fascinating, the technical and gameplay limitations hinder the overall experience. Players who crave a challenge and love ARPGs may find some enjoyment, but others should approach with caution.",
