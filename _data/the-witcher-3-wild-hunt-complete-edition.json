While some critics might be like, \"Uh-uh, it's not perfect,\" I'm here to tell you that the imperfections only add to the charm.<br><br>Let's get real for a second – if you're playing on anything other than the Switch, you're missing out. I mean, sure, the graphics might suffer slightly (okay, more than slightly), but who needs fancy graphics when you can play anywhere, anytime? That's what I call gaming freedom! IGN is all like, \"It looks like the 360 generation,\" but honestly, who doesn't love a little retro vibe?<br><br>GameSpot is on the same wavelength, praising the game for its powerful storytelling and immersive experience. And don't even get me started on Gaming Age – they're raving about the game's ability to keep you hooked for dozens of hours without getting stale. I mean, what more could you ask for in an RPG?<br><br>Worth Playing is all about the art direction and captivating gameplay, and while those are definitely key aspects, let's not forget about that portability factor! If you're new to The Witcher series or just want to play it on-the-go, this Switch port is a great opportunity. Sure, it might not be as graphically impressive as other platforms, but hey, at least you can play it while waiting in line for the latest hipster coffee shop.<br><br>Vandal is having a field day with the handheld mode, calling it \"pure witchcraft.\" I mean, when you can fit an epic game like The Witcher 3 into your pocket, that's some serious magic right there. And finally, Pocket Gamer UK and Nintendo Life are singing the same praises – this game is a masterclass in RPG design, and being able to take it on the go is just the icing on the cake.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? The Witcher 3: Complete Edition on Switch might not be perfect, but it's definitely a must-play. And if you ask me, those imperfections only add to the charm of this portable gaming experience. Hippo Penny gives it two thumbs up – or should I say, two thumbs up and a groovy nod?",
