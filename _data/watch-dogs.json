Let's get this ride started!<br><br>First off, I gotta say - these critics are raving about Watch Dogs like it's the next big thing since sliced bread (or should I say, since Ubisoft released Assassin's Creed?). IGN's giving it an 84, GameSpot's at 80, and Game Informer's at 85. Now, I'm no critic, but I do know that when you're this close to a perfect score, it's gotta be good... or is it?<br><br>Let me put on my review hat (which looks suspiciously like a hipster's fedora) - what sets Watch Dogs apart from other open-world games? For starters, the hacking abilities are pure genius! Who knew being a digital vigilante could be so much fun? It's like having a superpower, minus the whole \"saving the world\" thing (although, you never know, maybe I'll start a revolution).<br><br>The combat and stealth mechanics are solid too. It's not perfect - sometimes it feels like the game is trying to outdo Assassin's Creed with its over-the-top action sequences - but when it works, oh man, does it ever! You'll be sneaking around, hacking security systems, and taking down bad guys left and right.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the story?\" Well, let me tell you - it's not the strongest aspect of the game. The themes of personal security and government surveillance are important, but they get a bit lost in the midst of all the gang warfare (I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned turf war?). Still, it's a great surprise to see a game tackle these issues head-on.<br><br>All in all, Watch Dogs is an excellent addition to the open-world family. It may not be perfect, but when you're having this much fun exploring Chicago (or whatever city you choose), who cares? The frame-rate might drop occasionally, but trust me, it's worth it.<br><br>That's my two cents on Watch Dogs - if you haven't picked it up yet, what are you even doing with your life?",
