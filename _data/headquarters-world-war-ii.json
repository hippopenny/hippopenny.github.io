    "comment": "Headquarters World War II takes you on an unexpectedly deep dive into the complexities of humanity's greatest conflict, offering tense engagements and challenging tactical scenarios. While the visuals may seem simple, the gameplay is anything but, offering a rich experience reminiscent of XCOM. The ability to create custom battles adds an extra layer of engagement, giving players the chance to test their strategic prowess. However, the game suffers from some camera and AI issues that can detract from the overall experience. Nonetheless, for history buffs and strategy enthusiasts alike, Headquarters World War II is a compact and engaging wargame that demands attention to detail.",
