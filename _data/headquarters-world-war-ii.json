    "comment": "Headquarters: World War II brings a surprisingly deep strategy experience beneath its simple exterior. Step into the shoes of commanders in humanity's greatest conflict and immerse yourself in engrossing gameplay. From tense engagements to the option to create your own battles, this game offers a wide range of combat scenarios and keeps you hooked with its attention to detail. While the tactical battles may start feeling repetitive, the ability to customize scenarios and the unique approach of the three factions make it a compelling choice for strategy enthusiasts. Just beware of the camera and AI issues that can somewhat dampen the experience.",
