Despite some initial appearance of poor strategy, the game opens up to beautiful gameplay once you start a new game. With tense engagements, nice tactical scenarios, and the ability to create custom battles, it offers a compact and engaging wargaming experience. The three factions feel suitably different, providing a wide range of combat scenarios to challenge players. If you love games similar to XCOM, this title is definitely worth a try.",
