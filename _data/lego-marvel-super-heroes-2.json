I'm excited to share my thoughts on this action-packed adventure that combines the world of Marvel superheroes with the beloved LEGO franchise.<br><br>First off, let's get this out of the way: I'm a sucker for both LEGO games and Marvel movies. When these two worlds collide, magic happens! With over 200 playable characters, including fan favorites like Spider-Man and Thor, it's no surprise that this game has plenty to offer.<br><br>Now, onto my thoughts...<br><br>As IGN so astutely noted, \"it doesn't deviate much from the established LEGO template.\" In other words, if you've played previous LEGO games, you'll know what to expect. The combat is still relatively simple, and sometimes it can be tricky to determine what you should do next. BUT! The story is light-hearted and fun enough that these minor annoyances fade into the background.<br><br>GameSpot chimed in, stating that the game's \"basic cheerful gameplay\" makes all those extra activities worth doing (if you're a completionist or Marvel nut, that is). I agree – while some of those activities might not be enormous fun, they add to the game's charm. And hey, who doesn't love playing as their favorite Marvel character?<br><br>Gaming Age noted that, despite removing some characters from the first game, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 still packs a punch. The formula works (and will continue to work until people stop buying and playing them, wink-wink). This release is an improvement over the previous Marvel LEGO installment, LEGO Avengers.<br><br>Cheat Code Central praised the roster of over 200 characters, which is sure to delight fans. I concur – it's amazing to see so many beloved Marvel heroes come together in one game!<br><br>Vandal summed up the experience nicely: \"you won't find many new features here, but both the universe and formula are quite good, so the result is a very enjoyable game.\" Agreed! While there might not be groundbreaking innovations, the LEGO franchise has mastered its art.<br><br>SpazioGames echoed Vandal's sentiments, stating that the game doesn't try to revolutionize the LEGO formula, but rather builds upon its predecessor. The result? An entertaining experience with plenty of variety and situations to keep you going until the end.<br><br>Destructoid noted that while LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 still has the power to entertain, its core mechanics remain rooted in the past. This is true – if you're expecting massive changes or innovations, this game won't deliver. However, if you enjoy the LEGO formula and Marvel universe, you'll have a blast!<br><br>In conclusion, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 delivers an entertaining experience with plenty of variety and situations to keep you going until the end. While it might not deviate much from the established LEGO template, the sheer amount of playable characters and fun gameplay make this game worth playing – especially for fans of Marvel!",
