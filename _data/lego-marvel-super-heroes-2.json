Yay!<br><br>Before we dive in, let me just say that I'm not a Marvel super fanboy (okay, maybe a little), but I do love me some LEGO games! There's something so satisfying about smashing blocks with my favorite superheroes. <br><br>So, what's the verdict on LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2? Well, it seems like most critics agree that this game is more of the same, and that's not a bad thing! The variety of settings, heroes, and abilities keeps things fresh and fun to play, especially in co-op.<br><br>IGN gave it an 80, praising its constant entertainment value. GameSpot chimed in with a 70, saying it's still a winner, even if the formula is starting to get a little stale. Gaming Age also gave it high marks, calling it better than the previous Marvel LEGO game (LEGO Avengers).<br><br>Meanwhile, other critics were less enthusiastic. Destructoid gave it a 70, saying that while it's still entertaining, its core mechanics are stuck in the past. Vandal awarded it a 77, stating that you won't find many new features, but the universe and formula are both quite good.<br><br>Me? I think I'll just stick with my Hippo Penny- approved score: WOOHOO!<br><br>In all seriousness, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a great addition to the series. If you're a fan of LEGO games or Marvel, you'll have a blast playing through this one. And who knows, you might even learn something about the Marvel universe along the way!",
