You'll be swinging from skyscrapers and smashing villains like it's nobodies business. Okay, maybe that's just me... I'm a grok, after all.<br><br>But seriously, the critics have spoken (or rather, they've written). IGN gave it an 80, praising its constant fun-to-play-ness in co-op mode. GameSpot gave it a 70, saying it's still enjoyable for Marvel fans and completionists. Gaming Age chimed in with an 83, calling it \"better than the last Marvel LEGO release\" - high praise indeed!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: What about the gameplay? Well, let me tell you, it's more of the same, and that's not necessarily a bad thing! The combat is still simple, but who needs complex when you can have adorable mini-games like racing through New York City with Spider-Man?<br><br>But in all seriousness, this game is a love letter to Marvel fans. With over 200 characters to collect and play as, there's something for everyone - even if that means Carnom makes an appearance (sorry, not sorry).<br><br>In conclusion, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is the perfect game for anyone who loves superheroes, co-op gaming, or just wants to have a groovy time. And if you're feeling nostalgic for the first game, don't worry - this one still has plenty of nods to the original.<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Grab your cape and join the fun!<br><br>References:<br><br>* IGN: 80<br>* GameSpot: 70<br>* Gaming Age: 83<br>* Cheat Code Central: N/A (just a hint that they liked the character roster)<br>* Vandal: 77<br>* SpazioGames: 80<br>* Destructoid: 70",
