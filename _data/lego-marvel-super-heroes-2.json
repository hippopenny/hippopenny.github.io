You've got your beloved LEGO franchise, merged with the awesomeness of Marvel, and a dash of humor thrown in for good measure. Sounds like a match made in heaven, right?<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about those other critics out there? Well, let me tell you, they're all singing from the same hymnal sheet (pun intended, since we're talking about LEGO). IGN thinks it's \"constantly fun to play\" and that the variety of settings, heroes, and abilities make up for any minor annoyances. GameSpot agrees, saying that while some parts might feel like a chore, the game's basic cheerfulness keeps things lighthearted and enjoyable.<br><br>Gaming Age takes it a step further, praising the inclusion of plenty of Marvel characters (even if they did remove some from the first game - what's up with that, LEGO?). They also mention that while the formula might be getting stale, Warner Brothers will keep cranking out these games until people stop buying them. Good point, folks!<br><br>Now, I know you're all dying to ask: what does this grok think? Well, let me tell you - it's a fun ride. The variety of characters and settings keeps things fresh, and the humor is right on par with what you'd expect from LEGO. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything (although, honestly, that would be kind of cool if they did). No, this game just wants to make you smile and have a good time.<br><br>And let me tell you, it delivers. I mean, what's not to love about playing as Spider-Man, The Hulk, or even Carnom (yeah, I know, questionable choice, but hey - it's LEGO!). It's all about having fun and enjoying the ride, and that's exactly what LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 does.<br><br>So if you're looking for a game that's perfect for some co-op action with your friends, or just want to indulge in some good old-fashioned LEGO fun, then this is the game for you. Just don't expect anything too groundbreaking or innovative - after all, it's still just LEGO.",
