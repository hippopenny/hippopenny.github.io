It's time to review LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 and see if it's a superhero-ic game or just a bunch of bricks (get it?).<br><br>First off, let me say that I'm a big fan of the LEGO series. Who doesn't love smashing things and making funny jokes while playing as their favorite superheroes? It's a formula that works, and Warner Brothers keeps churning out games that are fun for all ages.<br><br>Now, back to LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2. IGN says it's \"constantly fun to play\" (Score: 80), especially with co-op gameplay. I mean, what's not to love about playing as Iron Man and Spider-Man together? You can fight crime, save the world, and maybe even make some dad jokes along the way.<br><br>GameSpot agrees that while the game may not be revolutionary, it's still a \"winner\" (Score: 70). They say it's all about being reverential to the source material – and who doesn't love a good Marvel movie or TV show? The reviewer at GameSpot mentions that if you're a completionist, you'll have plenty of fun running around as your favorite heroes.<br><br>Gaming Age chimes in with their 83 out of 100 score, saying it's \"better than the last Marvel LEGO release\" (LEGO Avengers). They do mention that some characters might be questionable (cough, Carnom), but overall, they think the game is a solid addition to the series.<br><br>Cheat Code Central gives it an 82, praising the roster of over two hundred characters. SpazioGames agrees, saying that while it doesn't change the formula, it builds upon the benefits of the previous game (Score: 80).<br><br>Vandal's review is more laid-back, giving it a score of 77 and saying that it's \"very enjoyable\" without trying to reinvent the wheel.<br><br>Last but not least, we have Destructoid with their score of 70. They say that while the game still entertains, its core mechanics are rooted in the past. Fair enough – I mean, you can't change what works!<br><br>In conclusion, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a fun-filled romp through the Marvel universe, perfect for fans of all ages. It's not going to break new ground or revolutionize the series, but it's a solid addition that will keep you entertained for hours on end.<br><br>So there you have it – my take on LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2. What do you think, fellow gamers? Are you ready to save the world and make some dad jokes along the way?",
