Let me just put on my thinking grok-hat and review this LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 game for ya!<br><br>As I dived into the world of bricks and superheroes, I couldn't help but think about those fancy-pants critics like IGN. They said it's \"constantly fun to play\" especially in co-op! Yeah, sure thing, IGN! You and your fellow gamers will have a blast building and battling together.<br><br>But what about GameSpot? They seemed a bit more skeptical, saying the game is \"starting to sag somewhat.\" Um, excuse me? The LEGO formula isn't exactly breaking new ground here, folks! It's like they're trying to reinvent the wheel (or in this case, the brick). Still, I can see why Marvel fans and completionists would enjoy it.<br><br>Gaming Age, on the other hand, is a big ol' fan of these LEGO games! They're like the ultimate Marvel-ites. \"Plenty of Marvel characters\" and all that jazz. I'm sure they were thrilled to see Carnom (I mean, who isn't?) and enjoyed the whole package.<br><br>Now, where's Vandal when you need 'em? They seem to have a thing for simplicity – \"You won't find many new features here\" – but hey, what's wrong with that? Sometimes less is more!<br><br>SpazioGames took a different approach. They saw LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 as building on the success of its predecessor (pun intended). I mean, who doesn't love a good build-athon?! Variety is key, and this game delivers.<br><br>Last but not least, Destructoid got a little existential on us. \"Core mechanics remain rooted firmly in the past.\" Yeah, yeah, yeah – we get it! You're trying to make some profound statement about time and change and stuff... Meanwhile, I'm over here having fun with my LEGO bricks!<br><br>All righty then, folks! That's my two cents (or should I say, two groks?) on LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2. It might not break new ground, but it's a darn good time – especially if you're a fan of the franchise!",
