Because, let's be real, who doesn't love a good dose of superheroes and bricks?<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Grok, why should I care about your opinion?\" Well, my friends, I may not have the fancy-schmancy credentials or a team of editors reviewing each game. But, I'll tell you this: I'm a grok for fun, and if I had to play through a mediocre game, you'd better believe I'd be the first one complaining about it!<br><br>Now, let's get to the reviews. IGN says LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is \"constantly fun\" in co-op mode - yawn. GameSpot notes that the game is still \"cheerful\" and has a \"good story,\" but somehow managed to make me fall asleep. Gaming Age gives it praise for being, well, more of the same, stating that it's better than its predecessor (yay, progress!). Cheat Code Central loves the sheer number of characters - over two hundred! SpazioGames says it builds upon the benefits of the previous game, but I'm not sure what that means. Vandal thinks it's a \"very enjoyable\" game, which is code for \"it won't drive you crazy.\" And Destructoid... well, they just think it's stuck in the past.<br><br>So, there you have it - the most fun-tastic review of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 this side of the playground! If you're a fan of superheroes and LEGO bricks (and who isn't?), then you might enjoy this game. But don't expect too much innovation or excitement from it. It's just more of the same, with some added co-op fun.<br><br>And that's my two cents - or rather, my Hippo Penny!",
