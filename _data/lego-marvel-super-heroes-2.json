I know what you're thinking - \"Why should I care about a game that's just a bunch of blocks and superheroes mashed together?\" Well, let me tell you, this game is more than just a bunch of blocks (although, let's be real, who doesn't love building with LEGO bricks?). It's a fun, family-friendly adventure that's all about embracing the Marvel universe in a way that's both lighthearted and loving.<br><br>Now, I know some folks might say, \"But what about the formula? Isn't it just the same old thing every time?\" And to those folks, I'd say, \"Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!\" The LEGO formula has been working for years now, and as long as people keep eating it up (pun intended), why mess with a good thing?<br><br>Of course, there are some critics out there who might disagree. Take IGN, for instance - they gave the game an 80, saying that while it doesn't deviate much from the established template, its variety of settings, heroes, and abilities make it constantly fun to play (especially in co-op). And I gotta say, I agree with them on that one. The more characters you get to play as, the more excited I get!<br><br>GameSpot, on the other hand, was a bit more downbeat, giving the game a 70 and saying that while it's still fun, it's starting to feel like they're just phoning it in at this point. And hey, I get what they mean - after all these years, it does seem like the LEGO formula is getting a little stale. But for me, as long as it's still building (see what I did there?), I'm happy.<br><br>Gaming Age was a bit more positive, giving the game an 83 and saying that while some characters might be missing from the first game, there are still plenty of Marvel favorites to play as. And let's be real, who doesn't love playing as Carnom? (Just kidding, that character is questionable at best...).<br><br>So what's my verdict on LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2? Well, I think it's a solid addition to the series - not groundbreaking, maybe, but still a heck of a lot of fun. And hey, even if you're not a die-hard LEGO fan (like me), there are plenty of Marvel characters to play as and storylines to enjoy.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny out!",
