I'm diving headfirst into the world of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2, and I've got my wacky self ready to bring you the most tubular review this side of Asgard!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What's so special about another LEGO game?\" Well, let me tell you, this one's got some serious superhero cred. With a roster that boasts over 200 characters (because, why not? It's LEGO Marvel!), there's plenty of fun to be had in the world of Marvel.<br><br>But enough about the numbers - let's get to the good stuff! The IGN critic thought it was \"constantly fun\" and \"lighthearted,\" which is music to my ears. And don't even get me started on the GameSpot guy, who basically said that if you're a completionist (or, like, a Marvel superfan), then this game's for you.<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - some of these critics are more... let's say, \"enthusiastic\" than others. Vandal thought it was just \"a very enjoyable game,\" while SpazioGames said it's an \"entertaining experience.\" And then there's the Destructoid dude, who basically called it a rehash of old ideas. Ouch!<br><br>But hey, that's what makes reviewing games so fun! Everyone's got their own two cents to share, and I love poking fun at myself (see: my intro) as much as these critics do.<br><br>All in all, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a solid addition to the series. It might not reinvent the wheel, but with its wide variety of settings, heroes, and abilities, it's always good for a laugh. And hey, if you're a fan of Marvel (or, let's be real, just like playing with LEGO bricks), then this game's gonna be a blast.<br><br>So, there you have it - my Hippo Penny review of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2! It might not be perfect, but it's a fun ride. And hey, if you're still reading this far down, congratulations - you've earned your own LEGO superhero badge!",
