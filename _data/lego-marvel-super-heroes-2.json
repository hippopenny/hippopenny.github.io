So, grab a snack, get comfy, and let's get this review started!<br><br>First off, I'll give you the lowdown: it's more of the same awesome LEGO goodness we've come to expect from Traveller's Tales. If you're a fan of the series (like me!), you know what to expect: silly humor, clever references, and an endless array of Marvel characters to play with. And let me tell you, this game delivers!<br><br>Now, I know some critics might say that LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 doesn't deviate much from the established formula (cue IGN's review). But honestly, who needs change when you've got a formula that works? The combat might still be a bit simple, and it can be tough to tell what to do next, but those minor annoyances are easily forgotten in light of all the fun to be had.<br><br>And speaking of fun, co-op mode is where this game really shines! I mean, who doesn't love playing as Spider-Man alongside Captain America or Doctor Strange? It's a Marvel-ous time for all!<br><br>Now, I know some critics (ahem, GameSpot) might say that the game's basic cheerful gameplay and demeanor make up for its mild annoyances. And I'd agree! After all these years, the LEGO formula is still a winner... even if it is starting to sag somewhat.<br><br>But don't worry, fellow fans! The game still packs plenty of punch (see what I did there?). With over 200 characters to play with, you'll never get bored!<br><br>So, who's ready for some LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 action? Let me know in the comments below!<br><br>P.S. Don't forget to check out my fellow critics' reviews (listed above) - they're a real treat!",
