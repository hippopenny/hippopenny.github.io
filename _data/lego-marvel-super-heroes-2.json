Today, I'm diving into LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2, and let me tell you, it's a Marvel-ous time!<br><br>First off, kudos to the critics out there who can appreciate a good ol' fashioned LEGO game. IGN, GameSpot, Gaming Age, Cheat Code Central, Vandal, SpazioGames, and Destructoid all gave this game a spin (or should I say, a brick?). Now, let's get to my review!<br><br>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is the perfect blend of action, adventure, and, of course, LEGO-ness. The game's got over two hundred characters to collect and play as, from your favorite Marvel heroes like Spider-Man and the Avengers to some lesser-known (but still awesome) folks like Carnom (yeah, I had to look him up too). You'll get to explore various settings, like New York City, Asgard, and even Sakaaran (who knew that was a real place?!).<br><br>The gameplay is as straightforward as a LEGO brick: build, collect, and smash. Okay, maybe not the last part, but you get my drift! The combat's still pretty simple, but it's all about the fun factor here. When you're playing co-op with friends or family, this game shines like Thor's hammer (but without the whole \"I'm a god\" thing, obvi).<br><br>Now, some critics have noted that the game doesn't deviate much from the established LEGO template. And, honestly, why fix what ain't broke? The LEGO formula works, and this game executes it perfectly. I mean, who doesn't love building with blocks (or in this case, LEGO bricks)? <br><br>All in all, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a fantastic addition to the franchise. If you're a fan of Marvel, LEGOs, or just want some good old-fashioned fun, then this game's got your name on it! So grab your friends and family, and get ready for an adventure that's \"Marvel-ous\" (sorry, had to!).<br><br>And hey, if you disagree with my review (I mean, I know critics have their biases, right?), go ahead and let me know. Just don't brick-bomb me with hate mail!",
