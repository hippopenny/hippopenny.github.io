But hear me out, folks!<br><br>Let's start with the good stuff. IGN says it's \"constantly fun to play, especially in co-op,\" and who can argue with that? Playing with friends is where the LEGO magic happens, am I right? You get to team up with Spidey, Thor, and the gang to take down bad guys and save the day - what's not to love?<br><br>But, of course, there are some minor quibbles. GameSpot says the combat can be a bit wonky, and it's hard to tell what you're supposed to do next. And Vandal agrees, stating that \"You won't find many new features here.\" Now, I'm not saying the game is perfect (far from it - I mean, have you seen my review skills? I'm still working on those...), but come on, folks! It's a LEGO game! You can't expect too much complexity, right?<br><br>On the flip side, the folks at Gaming Age and SpazioGames are singing this game's praises. They love the variety of characters, locations, and situations (I mean, who wouldn't want to play as Carnom? . And even Destructoid admits that it still has the power to entertain, even if the core mechanics are a bit dated.<br><br>All in all, I think we can safely say that LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a solid addition to the franchise. It might not break new ground, but it's a fun romp with friends and family - and what more could you ask for?<br><br>So, there you have it! That's my two cents on this brick-tastic game. If you're looking for some light-hearted Marvel fun, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is the way to go!<br><br>And if you're wondering about my own review skills... well, let's just say I'm still working on that whole \"original and witty\" thing. But hey, at least I tried, right?",
