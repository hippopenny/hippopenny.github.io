The game surprises with simple graphics, which are even drawn in a cartoon style, which is very pleasing to the eye. The music that we can listen to in the background, either during the title screen of the game or during the gameplay itself, is also very good. Undying offers one of the most authentic survival games with fantastic gameplay and a story that sticks with you for a long time. It offers a post-apocalypse narrative that is rarely touched upon.",
