Today, we're talking about Crime Boss: Rockay City, a game that's got everyone from IGN to Metro GameCentral scratching their heads (and not in a good way).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what's this reviewer going to say that's different from all the other critics? Well, let me tell you, I'm a seasonal grok, which means I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty and dive into the nitty-gritty of game design. And boy, does Rockay City need some serious digging.<br><br>First off, the voice acting is straight-up awful. I mean, I've heard better performances from a high school production of \"Grease.\" It's like they just phoned it in (or maybe that's what happened?). The script is laughable, with characters spouting out cringeworthy one-liners that make you wonder if the writers were trying to be edgy or just plain lazy.<br><br>But hey, even with all its flaws, Rockay City has some decent ideas. For instance, the roguelike elements are kind of cool (if a bit too shallow). And I'll give them props for trying something new with the game's structure. It's not all bad, folks!<br><br>Of course, that's where the praise ends and the complaining begins. The gameplay is just plain sloppy. I mean, who thought it was a good idea to make the player characters' AI so brain-dead that you can't even trust them to carry out basic orders? And don't get me started on those run-ending bugs - they're like the game's equivalent of a teenager's acne (you know, the kind that just won't go away no matter how hard you try).<br><br>Now, I know some of you are thinking, \"But [Reviewer], what about all the celebrity power behind this game? Surely that's gotta count for something!\" And to those folks, I say... yeah, okay, maybe. If only they'd used their star power to make a good game instead of just phoning it in. Alas, we're stuck with a mediocre mess that's more likely to induce yawns than thrills.<br><br>All things considered, Rockay City is a bit of a hot mess (just like my cat after she knocks over the trash can). But hey, if you're looking for some mindless fun and don't mind playing something that's only 40 bucks (and even cheaper with a sale), then go ahead and give it a shot. Just don't say I didn't warn you...",
