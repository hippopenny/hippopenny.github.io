Oh boy, do they have some strong feelings about this game. IGN called it an \"air ball\" (ouch!), Game Informer said it was a \"reminder that celebrity cast does nothing for a game when it's void of anything interesting or fun to support it\" (burn!). The rest... well, let's just say they didn't exactly get their hopes up either.<br><br>So, what's the deal with Crime Boss: Rockay City? Is it all hype and no substance? Do the celebrity cameos save the day or are they just window dressing?<br><br>Honestly, I think the game tries to be a lot of things - an open-world crime simulator, a rogue-like game, a Payday clone... and in doing so, it kind of fails at being any of those. But here's the thing: despite all its flaws, I found myself having fun playing Rockay City.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect. The voice acting can be cringeworthy (single takes intact, yeah...), the AI is wonky (shoot first, ask questions later), and some of the missions feel like a chore. But when you're cruising around in your sweet ride, taking down enemies with ease, or pulling off a heist with friends... it's hard not to enjoy yourself.<br><br>And hey, at least the game has co-op! If nothing else, that's something to bring some friends together and have a blast (literally).<br><br>All joking aside, Crime Boss: Rockay City is a game that's easy to dislike but kind of hard to hate. Maybe it's because I'm just a sucker for crime movies and games (90s or otherwise). Or maybe it's because I just like to have fun and not take myself too seriously.<br><br>So, should you give it a shot? Well, if you're looking for a game that's all flash, no substance... maybe not. But if you're up for a quirky, crime-ridden romp with some friends... hey, why not?",
