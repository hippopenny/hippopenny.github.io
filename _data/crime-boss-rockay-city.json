Even if the critics are saying it's a bit of a misstep (get it? Mis-step? Like a heist? Okay, moving on).<br><br>First off, let's talk about the IGN reviewer who called it an \"overly ambitious air ball\" and said the voice acting is some of the worst they've ever heard. Ouch, that's harsh! I mean, I'm sure even the most tone-deaf actors have their fans... but yeah, maybe not in this case.<br><br>Game Informer took a more measured approach, saying it's proof that star power isn't everything (um, duh). They went on to say that even when the bugs aren't crashing the game, Rockay City is just plain dull. Bummer! I mean, who doesn't love watching cutscenes with recognizable faces and voices?<br><br>Now, SpazioGames took a more balanced view, saying despite its many flaws, the game can be fun (at least, sometimes). They praised the game's good design ideas, but lamented the technical issues on PC. Ah, PC gamers, always having to deal with those pesky bugs!<br><br>GamingTrend said Crime Boss is all concept and no execution – it feels like you're just along for the ride, rather than actually driving the heist car (or, you know, helicopter). And don't even get them started on those cheap deaths.<br><br>But hey, Hardcore Gamer thought Rockay City was a great rogue-like game that might appeal to fans of 90s crime movies... as long as they're okay with repetition. Repetition! That's just what I want in my heist game!<br><br>Metro GameCentral took a more... let's say, scathing view (they called it an \"unlikeable, repetitive, and blandly designed clone\" of Payday). Yeah, I guess if you're gonna rip off another game, at least try to do it better?<br><br>And finally, CD-Action just kind of gave up, saying they expected nothing from Crime Boss but were still disappointed. Well, at least the co-op is fun... right? RIGHT?!<br><br>So there you have it – a whole bunch of critics having their say about Crime Boss: Rockay City. Me? I'll just keep on groovin', figuring out what's good and what's bad in this wild heist ride. Maybe you should join me!",
