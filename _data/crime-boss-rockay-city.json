    "comment": "Hippo Penny!<br><br>I'm thrilled to dive into Crime Boss: Rockay City, a game that's got everyone talking... or rather, shouting from the rooftops about its various issues. But before I get into the nitty-gritty, let me ask you, what's with all these critics saying it's like Payday or GTA clone? Did they even play those games or just glance at some screenshots?<br><br>Okay, enough small talk; onto the review! Crime Boss: Rockay City is a game that wants to be a big deal. It's got A-list celebrities lending their voices and faces to the game, which sounds great on paper... but in reality, it feels like a waste of talent. The voice acting? Abysmal. Some critics have said the worst part is how these \"celebrity\" actors sound like they're phoning it in. I'm not going that far, but let's just say some performances are as flat as a failed heist.<br><br>Now, the gameplay itself is where things get... complicated. The game tries to be an open-world crime sim with rogue-like elements and co-op play. Sounds cool on paper, but in practice, it feels like too much is trying to happen at once. You'll find yourself getting bogged down in repetitive missions, with too many cheap deaths and not enough sense of progression.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the bugs. I've heard stories about run-ending glitches that make the game unplayable. Yeah, no thanks! When a game is this buggy, it's like trying to build a sandcastle on quicksand – you just know it's going to collapse under its own weight.<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, I'm not as harsh as some critics. I mean, there are moments when the gameplay clicks, and you feel like a real crime boss. But those moments are few and far between. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack – except the needle is a fun game mechanic, and the haystack is a sea of repetition.<br><br>All in all, Crime Boss: Rockay City is a game that wants to be more than it is. It's got great ideas, but they're not executed as well as they could be. If you're looking for a co-op experience with some friends, this might be worth checking out – but if you're expecting a deep, engaging crime sim? Think again.",
