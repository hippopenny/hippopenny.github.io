I mean, IGN, you got it right when you called the voice acting \"the worst of which sound like single takes spliced in with mistakes intact.\" Ouch, that's some harsh criticism! But honestly, who doesn't love a little bit of wonky audio to spice up their gameplay?<br><br>Game Informer, on the other hand, seems to be all about the lackluster experience. \"A painful dull take on organized crime\" might just be the most apt description I've heard all week. And don't even get me started on those run-ending bugs - talk about a real gangster movie moment (minus the excitement and intrigue, of course).<br><br>But hey, SpazioGames is trying to stay positive! \"Often fun\" is a great start, even if it's tempered by some serious technical issues. I mean, who doesn't love a little bit of frustration every now and then? And that structure, though - well, let's just say it's not exactly the most polished thing in the world.<br><br>GamingTrend seems to be all about the concept versus execution. \"So many conceptually interesting gameplay mechanics\" sounds great on paper, but what about when they're bogged down by poor design and cheap deaths? I mean, it's like they're saying, \"Hey, we've got some cool ideas, but can't you just imagine doing them better?\" Yeah, that's exactly what I want from my gaming experience - a little bit of imagination-based gameplay.<br><br>And finally, Hardcore Gamer is all about the niche appeal. If you love rogue-like games and 90s crime movies (and don't mind a healthy dose of repetitiveness), then Crime Boss: Rockay City might just be the game for you! But if you're thinking Payday or GTA clone, well... let's just say that ship has sailed.<br><br>Metro GameCentral, though, is all about the harsh realities. An unlikeable, repetitive, and blandly designed game that wastes its celebrity-filled cast on a substandard script? Ouch, that hurts. I mean, who wants to play as Danny Trejo when the writing is this bad?<br><br>And CD-Action... well, let's just say they're not exactly thrilled with the final product. \"I didn't expect much and I'm still disappointed\" might just be the most accurate review I've heard all week. I mean, where's the excitement in a mediocre game with some interesting ideas that fail to pan out?<br><br>All in all, it looks like Crime Boss: Rockay City is a bit of a mixed bag. Some folks will have fun with its roguelike elements and 90s crime movie vibes, while others will be left feeling disappointed and frustrated by the game's many flaws. Me? I'm just happy to have gotten through this review without any major bugs or AI issues. Hippo Penny out!",
