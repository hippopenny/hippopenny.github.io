Crime Boss: Rockay City is a game that's got some big names attached to it, but does it live up to its promises? Let's get into it!<br><br>First off, I've gotta give props to IGN for their brutal honesty. \"Crime Boss: Rockay City is an overly ambitious air ball on all fronts...\" Yeah, they weren't messing around! They called out the game's sloppy gameplay and cringeworthy voice acting, and honestly, I can't blame them one bit. If you're gonna bring in big names like Jamie Foxx and Pierce Brosnan, at least make sure the script is good, right?<br><br>Game Informer took a different approach, saying that Crime Boss is proof that star power isn't everything. They're right, too! A celebrity cast doesn't mean squat if the game itself is dull and uninteresting. I mean, even without bugs, Rockay City just felt... meh.<br><br>Now, SpazioGames saw some good in Crime Boss, despite its flaws. They said it's often fun, and you'll wonder what would've happened if you approached things differently. That's a great point! Sometimes, it's all about the little choices you make in-game that can change everything. Unfortunately, those little choices are hard to come by when the game feels unpolished.<br><br>GamingTrend had some harsh words for Crime Boss as well. They said the game has some conceptually interesting mechanics, but they just don't get used enough or tie into other aspects of the game. That's a shame! When you've got great ideas, but no one to share 'em with... <br><br>Hardcore Gamer liked Rockay City, though! If you're into rogue-like games and 90s crime movies, this might be your jam. Just don't expect it to be Payday or GTA, because it ain't.<br><br>Metro GameCentral just straight-up hated Crime Boss, saying it's a blandly designed clone of Payday that wastes its celebrity cast on an equally substandard script. Ouch! That's some tough love right there.<br>And finally, CD-Action didn't expect much from Rockay City and still got disappointed. They said the game had some interesting ideas (like rogue-like elements), but they just couldn't outweigh the dated design, awful AI, and poor writing. Well, at least it has co-op!<br><br>So there you have it, folks! Crime Boss: Rockay City is a game that's got some big names attached to it, but when it comes down to it, the gameplay just isn't there. Unless you're really into rogue-like games and 90s crime movies, I'd say pass on this one.<br><br>That's it for now! Until next time, when I'll be reviewing another game that's probably gonna get roasted...",
