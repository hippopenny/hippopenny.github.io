Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Why should I care about some gangster game?\" Well, let me tell you, this one's got star power (pun intended). But before we dive in, let's take a peek at what the other critics had to say.<br><br>Oh boy, it looks like Crime Boss: Rockay City is getting a rough ride. IGN gave it a dismal 40, calling it \"an overly ambitious air ball on all fronts.\" Game Informer wasn't much kinder, saying it's a reminder that even celebrity power can't save a game from being dull and unengaging (ouch). But don't worry, folks - SpazioGames gave it a decent 68, saying despite its flaws, it's often fun.<br><br>Now, let's get to the good stuff. As I played through Crime Boss: Rockay City, I found myself enjoying the game's roguelike elements and the sense of building my own criminal empire. It's not perfect, but there's something to be said for the satisfaction of pulling off a heist or growing your crew.<br><br>Of course, there are some caveats. The game can be a bit wonky at times, with bugs and glitches cropping up here and there. But hey, even the most seasoned pros have to deal with technical issues now and then, right?<br><br>All in all, Crime Boss: Rockay City is a game that's definitely worth checking out - especially if you're a fan of 90s crime movies or rogue-like games. Just don't expect it to be Payday or GTA, because it's not that kind of game.<br><br>So what are you waiting for? Get ready to join the criminal underworld and start building your own empire in Crime Boss: Rockay City!",
