Well, not exactly nightmarish, but more like a thrilling experience.<br><br>As you may have guessed from the above scores and comments (I hope you didn't just randomly scroll down without reading them), this game has received praise from various critics. DarkStation gave it a perfect score, saying it's an edge-of-your-seat experience that will leave fans of the first game in awe. Who wouldn't want to be on the edge of their seat? Sounds comfy!<br><br>Shacknews also praised the game, calling it \"better than the first\" and describing Pale City as a great new location with unique characters and creatures. Not bad for a sequel! I mean, you'd think they'd have run out of ideas by now (just kidding, sorta).<br><br>But hey, WellPlayed wasn't overly impressed, giving it an 85. They said it doesn't reinvent the wheel but still hits all the same notes – which is just enough for them to declare it a \"must-play.\" Yeah, because who needs innovation, right?<br><br>Playstation Official Magazine UK did find fault with some parts, saying the controls could be more responsive... or maybe that's just me being impatient. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Power Unlimited's review, which gave it an 78 despite mentioning frustrating gameplay elements inherited from its predecessor (aka the usual console experience).<br><br>Finally, VGC mentioned this was a cautiously expansive sequel and praised the detail in its locations (I assume that means beautiful backgrounds... not necessarily the game itself?) but then just wished for more. Okay, same.<br><br>Push Square had the lowest score with 60 out of 100 – which probably means I wasn't invited to their focus group (no joke). Their review states this title relies far too heavily on trial and error... like it's actually an accomplishment to be better than nothing!<br><br>Alright, that concludes our little analysis. So, what did we learn today? Well, the main takeaway is: Little Nightmares II has gotten varying reviews across different platforms – ranging from praise to lukewarm reception! Who'd have thought?!<br><br>Hippo out (just kidding, I'll stick around).",
