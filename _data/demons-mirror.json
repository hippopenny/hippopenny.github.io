In all seriousness, this deckbuilder has received some fantastic reviews from the critics, and today, I'll be diving into what makes them tick.<br><br>**Chain-3 Mechanics for the Win?**<br>Hey Poor Player gave Demon's Mirror a 100% review, praising its clever implementation of chain-3 mechanics. Now, I'm not exactly sure what that means (I'm no expert), but it sounds cool, right? Essentially, this game combines deck-building with tile-matching gameplay to create something truly unique.<br><br>**GLHF on Sports Illustrated loves the Complex Mechanics**<br>GLHF on Sports Illustrated gave Demon's Mirror an 80% review, saying that it makes for a \"harmony of interlocking systems\" that all shine brightly when you're forced to bounce between each one. That sounds like fun - kind of like a puzzle game, but with more cards and fewer pieces.<br><br>**Checkpoint Gaming: Demons, Mirrors, and Repeat Enemies galore**<br>Checkpoint Gaming also gave the game an 80% review, stating it's \"a hell of a good time\" that combines deckbuilding and grid battle systems. They did warn that enemies can be repetitive (which I'd imagine is a given), but overall, this one's worth checking out.<br><br>**Other Critics Weigh In**<br>God is a Geek and WellPlayed both gave Demon's Mirror an 80% review, using terms like \"seriously clever\" and \"fiercely unique.\" GameGrin chimed in with a 70% review, saying that the game's complex mechanics might throw you off track. Lastly, GameSpew scored it a bit lower at 60%, stating that while it's not bad, Demon's Mirror \"doesn't quite pull it off.\"<br><br>**Conclusion**<br>So there you have it - this season's must-try deckbuilder! Don your thinking caps (or in my case, attempt to put together the pieces), and tackle the ever-changing puzzle that is Demon's Mirror. Just don't blame me when you get killed by those repetitive enemies",
