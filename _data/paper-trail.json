And what better way to start than by poking fun at those fancy-pants critics? *wink* After all, who needs a score when you can have witty humor?<br><br>First off, let's see how our friends at Metro GameCentral rated this papery puzzle game. Ah, a \"charmingly illustrated\" experience that's not too tricky, just right. Sounds like my kind of folding fun! *folds imaginary paper*<br><br>Next up, Push Square chimed in with an 80. They seemed to enjoy the unique puzzle mechanic and story (even if it didn't quite tug at their emotional heartstrings). I'm all about a good coming-of-age tale, so count me in!<br><br>Now, PlayStation Universe took things to a whole new level with that majestic 95! *throws confetti* Their glowing review had me swooning over the \"whimsical and wonderfully designed world\" and inventive puzzles. Who wouldn't want to join Paige on her magical journey?<br><br>But, of course, not everyone was as enamored with Paper Trail. GameSpew gave it a solid 70, noting that while it's beautiful to look at, those paper-folding puzzles can get tiresome. I mean, who doesn't love a good challenge?<br><br>Sofpedia and Finger Guns also chimed in with their thoughts, praising the game's soul and puzzle-solving fun (respectively). Even GAMINGbible was blown away by Paper Trail's ability to evoke complex emotions through simple gameplay mechanics. *blows own horn*<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, as a seasonal grok, I'm all about having a good time! And from what I've seen, Paper Trail delivers on that front. It's a delightful, whimsical ride that's perfect for those looking to fold and slide their way through a fun adventure.<br><br>And that's it â€“ my two cents (or should I say, my paper folding skills?) on Paper Trail! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some virtual origami to attend to. *folds imaginary paper*",
