Buckle up, fellow gamers!<br><br>As I delved into this charming indie game, I couldn't help but notice the delightful artistry and attention to detail that went into crafting its unique world.

GameSpew, however, brought it back down to earth with a 70, stating that the puzzles might be an acquired taste and could become tiresome.<br><br>Finger Guns offered up an 80, praising the game's design and visuals while acknowledging the story might be a bit formulaic.

Sure, there might be some minor quibbles with the story or hint system, but overall, I'm hooked!<br><br>In conclusion, Paper Trail is a must-play for anyone looking for a unique puzzle-solving experience that'll wrap you up in its whimsical world.
