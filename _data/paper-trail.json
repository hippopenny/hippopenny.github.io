    "comment": "Hippo Penny! Let's get this review party started!<br><br>Paper Trail is the kind of game that will make you fold, unfold, and refold your expectations (see what I did there?). At its core, it's a top-down puzzle game about paper folding, and I'm here for it! The unique mechanic has just enough intricacy to keep me engaged without making me feel like a crumpled up piece of paper.<br><br>Now, let's take a stroll down review lane. Metro GameCentral gave it a 70, saying it's \"charmingly illustrated\" with a \"perspective-shifting puzzle game.\" That sounds about right – I mean, who doesn't love a good fold? Push Square echoed the sentiment, giving it an 80 and praising its unique puzzle mechanic. Playful, right?<br><br>But don't worry, folks; not everyone's a fan of this folded paper trail. GameSpew gave it a 70, saying the puzzles can be \"tiresome\" and that some players might struggle to digest more than a couple of levels at a time. That's fair – even I got a little frustrated when my folds didn't quite turn out as planned.<br><br>On the other hand, some critics went full-on Origami-geddon! PlayStation Universe gave it a 95, calling it \"a game that sets out to do so with a clear passion and mastery of craft.\" That's high praise indeed – almost as high as GAMINGbible's 90, which called Paper Trail \"a simple story told via... the art of virtual origami\" (see what they did there?).<br><br>All in all, I'm hooked on this paper trail! With its beautiful hand-drawn art, addictive puzzle mechanic, and whimsical world, it's a must-play for anyone looking to fold their way into some fun.<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go fold some more papers.",
