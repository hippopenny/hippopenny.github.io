Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What's the big deal about folding paper?\" Well, let me tell you, my friend, this game is more than just a simple puzzle. It's a journey of self-discovery, wrapped up in a beautifully illustrated world (get it? Wrapped? Like origami? Okay, moving on...).<br><br>First off, the critics are divided. Metro GameCentral gave it a score of 70, saying it's \"charmingly illustrated\" and has just enough complexity to keep you engaged. Meanwhile, Push Square scored it an 80, praising its unique puzzle mechanic and gorgeous visuals. On the other end of the spectrum, GameSpew thought the puzzles could get tiresome at times, giving it a score of 70.<br><br>Now, I'm not here to summarize every critic's opinion (although, if you're looking for a summary, I can give you that too). I'm here to share my own thoughts on Paper Trail. And let me tell you, this game is all about the journey, baby! You play as Paige, folding and unfolding paper to solve puzzles and unlock new areas. It's meditative, it's calming, and it's downright delightful.<br><br>The art style is gorgeous - think hand-drawn illustrations with a whimsical touch. The soundtrack is equally lovely, although I do agree with Softpedia that it gets a bit repetitive at times (I mean, how many times can you listen to the same melody before you start to fold under the pressure... sorry, had to).<br><br>But what really makes Paper Trail shine is its ability to balance simplicity and complexity. The puzzles might seem simple at first, but as you progress, they get progressively more challenging. And yet, it never feels like a slog - there's always that sense of accomplishment when you figure out the solution.<br><br>GAMINGbible got it right when they said it's \"a charming game that elicits so many complex human emotions.\" I mean, who doesn't love watching Paige unfold (see what I did there?) and grow as she navigates this fantastical world?<br><br>In conclusion, Paper Trail is a must-play for anyone looking for a unique puzzle experience. And if you're like me, you'll find yourself smiling from ear to ear as you fold and unfold your way through this delightful game.<br><br>Now, go forth and fold, my friends!",
