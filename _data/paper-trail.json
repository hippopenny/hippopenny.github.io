As I dive in, I'll be poking fun at myself and other critics (because let's be real, we're all a bit silly sometimes).<br><br>First off, let's talk about the art style – hand-drawn and gorgeous! It's like someone took all their favorite origami sheets and folded them into a game. Okay, maybe that's a weird analogy, but you get the idea. The visuals are stunning, making each level feel like a work of art in progress.<br><br>Now, onto the gameplay: Paper Trail is all about folding and unfolding paper (obviously). It sounds simple, but trust me, it gets tricky fast. You'll need to use perspective-shifting skills (like those critics mentioned) to navigate Paige's journey through this whimsical world. I won't lie; some levels did make my head spin – in a good way! The puzzles are cleverly designed, and the feeling of accomplishment when you finally solve one is unbeatable.<br><br>But what about the story? Well, it's sweet (pun intended), if not entirely unexpected. It's your typical coming-of-age tale with a dash of whimsy. Don't worry; it won't leave you feeling stumped or underwhelmed – just pleasantly entertained.<br><br>Now, let's take a peek at what some other critics have said:<br><br>* Metro GameCentral: \"Charming... perspective-shifting puzzle game... keeps you engaged without ever making you feel stumped.\"<br>* Push Square: \"Paper Trail is a charming game with an interesting and unique puzzle mechanic.\"<br>* PlayStation Universe: \"For what Paper Trail sets out to do – it does so with clear passion and mastery of craft...\"<br>* GameSpew: \"Beautiful hand-drawn art... puzzles can quickly grow tiresome.\"<br>* PlayStation Country: \"Fine puzzle game with lovely origami mechanic...\"<br>* Softpedia: \"Indie game with plenty of soul... mixes successfully the narrative and gameplay parts into an immersive experience.\"<br>* Finger Guns: \"Eloquent in design that never loses its puzzling magic...\"<br><br>Some critics were stumped (ahem, GameSpew), while others praised the game's unique mechanics (Finger Guns). I think it's safe to say that Paper Trail is a puzzle game that will appeal to fans of clever level design and beautiful visuals.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny says: if you're ready for a challenge that's both aesthetically pleasing and intellectually stimulating, then fold yourself into Paper Trail.",
