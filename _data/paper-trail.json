It's your buddy, [Your Name], back with another review that's guaranteed to make you laugh, cry (from laughter), and maybe even learn a thing or two about the amazing world of video games!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Why should I care about Paper Trail?\" Well, let me tell you, this game is not just any ordinary puzzle game. It's like a box full of surprises that will keep you engaged for hours on end. And don't even get me started on the visuals - they're as stunning as a freshly unfolded origami bird!<br><br>But enough about me, let's talk about what some other critics have to say. The New York Times gave it a respectable 75%, saying it's \"a top-down fairy tale\" with beautiful watercolor backgrounds (I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned watercolor background?). Pocket Gamer UK thinks it's one of the best Netflix Games out there (Netflix Games? Who knew?), and Nintendo Life raves about its \"finest puzzle games\" on the Switch right now. And don't even get me started on those other reviewers - they're like a box full of surprises themselves!<br><br>Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking: \"What's this game actually about?\" Well, let me tell you, Paper Trail is all about helping Page (the protagonist) follow her dreams to college by folding papers into paths and avoiding obstacles. Sounds easy? Think again! The mechanics are simple yet challenging, and the storybook narrative will keep you hooked from start to finish.<br><br>And that's not all - the game also has some beautiful environments, beautifully detailed ink illustrations, and an overall feel-good vibe. It's like a warm hug for your brain (or should I say, \"folded\" into one? Ba-dum-tss!).<br><br>In conclusion, Paper Trail is a must-play for any puzzle enthusiast out there. Trust me when I say that you won't regret this 20-minute playthrough (ahem, it took me longer than that...). So, go ahead and give it a try - and don't forget to share your thoughts in the comments below!",
