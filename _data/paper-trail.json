With its unique paper-folding mechanic, this indie gem has captured the hearts of many critics (check out those scores!). But, let me tell you - I'm not just here to gush over the game's adorable protagonist, Paige. No way! As a self-proclaimed master of sass and critique, I'll dive into what makes Paper Trail tick... or should I say, fold?<br><br>First off, the art. Oh boy, the art! Hand-drawn visuals that will make you feel like you're flipping through a whimsical journal. The game's world is as beautiful as it is immersive - you'll find yourself getting lost in Paige's journey, even when things get tricky.<br><br>Now, about those puzzles... As I folded my way through levels, I discovered that the game strikes just the right balance between challenge and reward. You see, Paper Trail is all about figuring out how to manipulate Paige's paper creations to solve increasingly complex problems. It's a slow burn, but when you finally get it - ah! The sense of accomplishment is almost as satisfying as folding a perfect origami crane.<br><br>Of course, no game is without its quirks. Some critics have noted the repeating soundtrack (guilty as charged!), and I agree that it can get a tad grating after a while. Additionally, the hint system could be more precise in guiding players through those tricky moments.<br><br>Still, when you factor in the game's passion project vibes, Paper Trail's mastery of craft, and its cleverness, it's hard not to love this little indie gem. Heck, I'm already imagining the awards and accolades this baby will rack up!<br><br>So, if you're looking for a puzzle game that will charm your way into your heart (and maybe even teach you a thing or two about patience and persistence), look no further than Paper Trail! Just don't say I didn't warn you - those origami skills of yours might just get put to the test...<br><br>That's it for now, folks! Stay tuned for more reviews that are guaranteed to bring a smile to your face... or at least, not make me cringe too much.",
