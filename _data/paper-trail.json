But Paper Trail? It's like a puzzle-filled oasis in the desert of gaming mediocrity. And hey, if you're like me, always looking for that next great thing, then read on!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Paper Trail\" sounds like some artsy-fartsy nonsense, but trust me, this game is more than just a bunch of paper folding (although, let's be real, it's pretty cool too). No sir, Paper Trail is all about perspective-shifting puzzle-solving, and I'm here for it!<br><br>But don't just take my word for it; the critics are raving too! Metro GameCentral gave it a solid 70, saying it's \"charmingly illustrated\" with enough intricacy to keep you engaged. Push Square was equally impressed, giving it an 80 for its unique puzzle mechanic and sweet coming-of-age tale.<br><br>Now, I know some folks might say that the story is a bit lacking (PlayStation Universe gave it a 95, but let's be real, those guys are always on the lookout for something to swoon over). But hey, the puzzles more than make up for it! And don't even get me started on the visuals – GameSpew said it's \"beautiful\" and I gotta agree.<br><br>Of course, not everyone is a fan. Some folks at GameSpew thought the puzzles got old fast, but I'm here to tell you, they're just getting started!<br><br>And let's give it up for PlayStation Country, who gave Paper Trail an 80 for its fine puzzle-solving and excellent presentation.<br><br>But what about Softpedia? They gave it a 75, saying it's \"fascinating\" and all, but also mentioning some repetitive soundtrack and wonky hint system. Yeah, yeah, I get it – nobody's perfect!<br><br>Finger Guns, on the other hand, loved Paper Trail, giving it an 80 for its perfect implementation of the ever-folding world.<br><br>So there you have it – my take on Paper Trail! It's a game that'll keep you folding and sliding your way to puzzle-solving bliss. And hey, if you don't like it? Well, as I always say: \"Hippo Penny ain't nobody's friend!\"",
