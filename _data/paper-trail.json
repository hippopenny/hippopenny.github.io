Here's my take on Paper Trail, the puzzle game that'll have you folding and sliding your way to enlightenment.<br><br>Let me get this straight: I'm a seasonal grok video game reviewer with a penchant for wit and humor. My friends (okay, fellow critics) at Metro GameCentral gave it 70/100, saying it's \"charmingly illustrated\" with puzzles that are just right – not too hard, not too easy.

They rave about the game's passion and mastery of craft, saying it's a \"whimsical and wonderfully designed world.\" Okay, I might have swooned a little.

They'll have you folding and sliding like a paper ninja.<br><br>In the end, if you're looking for a charming puzzle game with a unique mechanic and beautiful visuals, Paper Trail is worth giving a shot. Just don't say I didn't warn you about those repetitive soundtracks<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, that would be telling...",
