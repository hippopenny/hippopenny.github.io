The game's got some serious charm going on, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a seasonal grok reviewer with a penchant for whimsy (although, let's be real, it doesn't hurt).<br><br>The gameplay is all about folding and unfolding paper to solve puzzles â€“ think origami meets portal-ing. It's a unique mechanic that had me giggling with glee one minute and face-palming with frustration the next. But hey, that's what makes puzzle games so delightful, right?<br><br>Now, let's take a look at what some other critics have to say (because, let's be real, who doesn't love reading about what others think of a game?).<br><br>* Metro GameCentral gives it a solid 70, saying it's \"charmingly illustrated\" and \"has just enough intricacy to keep you engaged.\" Yawn.<br>* Push Square goes all-out with an 80, calling it a \"charming game\" with a \"unique puzzle mechanic.\" Zzz...<br>* PlayStation Universe gets all sappy with a 95, saying it's a \"wonderfully designed world that manages to mix an inventive new twist on top-down puzzling with a heartening premise.\" *Swoon*<br>* GameSpew gives it a lackluster 70, saying the puzzles can get tiresome and the art is \"gorgeous, but not enough to save the game from its repetitive nature.\" Bummer.<br>* Softpedia chimes in with a 75, calling it an \"immersive experience\" with some minor flaws like repetition and poor hinting. Meh.<br>* Finger Guns gives it an 80, saying it's a \"great entry into the puzzle genre\" with perfect implementation of the ever-folding world. Yay!<br>* GAMINGbible goes all out with a 90, calling it \"a simple story told via... simple gameplay mechanic\" that somehow manages to elicit complex human emotions. Mind. Blown.<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, Hippo Penny loves a good puzzle game, and Paper Trail delivers. It's a delightful ride that'll keep you entertained for hours on end. And hey, even if the puzzles get tiresome (which they might), the art is gorgeous enough to make up for it.<br><br>All in all, Paper Trail is a charming little indie game that's worth your time and attention. Go forth and fold some paper, friends!",
