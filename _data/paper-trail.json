Today, we're diving into the whimsical world of Paper Trail, a game that has got everyone folding and unfolding like they're trying to make origami out of their sanity!<br><br>So, let's get this out of the way – the critics are divided (as always). Some think it's a charmingly illustrated puzzle game with just the right amount of intricacy (Metro GameCentral), while others call it a \"fine\" puzzle game that will delight and confound you (PlayStation Country). But what do I think? Well, I'll get to that in a jiffy!<br><br>First off, let me say that Paper Trail is an absolute visual stunner. The hand-drawn art is gorgeous, and the game's whimsical world is full of colorful characters and delightful little details. It's like stepping into a beautifully illustrated children's book (if said book was also a challenging puzzle game).<br><br>Now, onto the gameplay! This is where things get really interesting (and sometimes frustratingly hard). The core mechanic is all about folding and unfolding paper to create new paths or reveal hidden areas. Sounds simple, right? Well, it isn't as easy as it seems, especially when you're dealing with pesky obstacles like sticky notes and torn papers. But that's the beauty of Paper Trail – the puzzles are cleverly designed, but not so difficult that they become insurmountable.<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect (except maybe Super Mario Bros., but let's not get into that). Some critics have mentioned that the repeating soundtrack can be a bit grating, and I agree. A little more variety would've been nice. But honestly, it's a small complaint in an otherwise delightful package.<br><br>All in all, Paper Trail is a must-play for anyone who loves puzzle games (or just likes making pretty origami). With its gorgeous visuals, clever puzzles, and whimsical charm, this game will keep you folded up (sorry, had to!) for hours on end. And hey, even if the story doesn't exactly \"reach the emotional highs\" like some critics have said, it's still a sweet little tale that adds to the overall package.<br><br>So there you have it – my Hippo Penny review of Paper Trail! *wink* Now go forth and fold, er, I mean, play this game!",
