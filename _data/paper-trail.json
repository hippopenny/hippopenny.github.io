And by \"everyone,\" I mean critics who are probably way smarter than me and actually know what they're doing when it comes to reviewing games.<br><br>I'm just a seasonal grok (whatever that means), but I'll give you my two cents: Paper Trail is an absolute delight! The perspective-shifting puzzle game is all about folding paper, and trust me, it's not as boring as it sounds. In fact, it's so engaging that I found myself getting stuck in the most wonderful way possible - trying to figure out how to fold that pesky paper just one more time.<br><br>Now, let's see what the big shots have to say about this game. Metro GameCentral gave it a 70, calling it \"charmingly illustrated\" and saying it's got just enough intricacy to keep you engaged without making you feel stumped. Push Square also gave it an 80, praising its unique puzzle mechanic and beautifully atmospheric soundtrack.<br><br>But what really gets me excited is the love-fest over at PlayStation Universe. They're gushing about Paper Trail, saying it sets out to do one thing - make a wonderful game that's all about virtual origami - and nails it with a clear passion and mastery of craft. Even GAMINGbible is blown away, calling it \"charming\" and saying it elicits complex human emotions via the art of virtual origami.<br><br>Of course, not everyone is as smitten. GameSpew gave it a 70, saying that while its puzzles are cleverly designed, they can quickly grow tiresome. And Softpedia thinks there's room for improvement - maybe a more precise hint system and a less repetitive soundtrack.<br><br>But you know what? I think we can all agree on one thing: Paper Trail is an absolute blast to play! It's a game that's perfect for puzzle fans of all ages, and the story is just sweet enough to keep things interesting. So grab some paper (real or virtual), get folding, and join me in this delightful adventure!",
