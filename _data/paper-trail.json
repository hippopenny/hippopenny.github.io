Yes, you read that right â€“ Paper Trail is the game I'm talking about, and it's a real treat!<br><br>Let's get to the critics first, shall we? Metro GameCentral gives it 70%, saying it's \"charmingly illustrated\" and has just enough complexity to keep you engaged without feeling stuck. Push Square agrees, giving it an 80% and calling it a \"charming game with an interesting and unique puzzle mechanic.\" PlayStation Universe goes full-on gushy, giving it a 95% and saying it's a \"whimsical and wonderfully designed world\" that will leave you feeling all the feels.<br><br>Now, about those other critics... GameSpew thinks it's beautiful, but also says the puzzles can get tiresome. Softpedia gives it a 75%, saying it's an immersive experience with some room for improvement (like a more precise hint system). Finger Guns likes it too, giving it an 80% and calling it \"eloquent in design.\" GAMINGbible takes things to the next level with a 90%, saying Paper Trail is a game that \"elicit[s] so many complex human emotions all via the simple art of virtual origami.\"<br><br>So, what's my take on this papery puzzle fest? Well, I think it's a hoot! The graphics are gorgeous, and the puzzles are clever without being too hard or too easy. It's like a little piece of origami heaven in your hands.<br><br>In conclusion, Paper Trail is a must-play for anyone who loves puzzle games. And if you don't love them (yet), this game will probably change your mind. Hippo Penny out!",
