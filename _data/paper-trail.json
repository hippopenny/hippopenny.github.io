Okay, moving on...).<br><br>This time around, I'm diving into the whimsical world of Paper Trail, a puzzle game that'll have you twisting and turning (not just figuratively) to solve its cleverly crafted paper-folding puzzles. But enough about me; let's get to the critics!<br><br>First off, we've got Metro GameCentral with a score of 70. They say Paper Trail is \"charmingly illustrated\" and has \"just enough intricacy\" to keep you engaged without feeling overwhelmed. Yeah, yeah, I've heard that before – but hey, it's hard not to be charmed by those cute animations!<br><br>Next up, we have Push Square with an 80. They praise the game's unique puzzle mechanic and \"gorgeous world\" complemented by a \"beautifully atmospheric soundtrack.\" You know what would make this review even better? If they gave me a shout-out for my impeccable taste in video games (just kidding, kind of)!<br><br>Now, let's get to the big guns: PlayStation Universe with a whopping 95! They're absolutely smitten with Paper Trail, calling it \"a clear passion project\" that \"rarely seen in the industry today.\" I mean, when a game makes you feel all the feels (or at least, that's what they said), you know it's doing something right!<br><br>But not everyone is singing the same tune. GameSpew gives Paper Trail 70 points, saying its puzzles can be tiresome and some players might struggle to digest more than a few levels at a time. Yeah, yeah, I've heard that before – but hey, someone's gotta keep it real, am I right?<br><br>Sofpedia weighs in with an 80, praising the game's ability to mix narrative and gameplay into an immersive experience. They also mention some minor flaws, like the repeating soundtrack (tell me about it, buddy!) and a hint system that could use some fine-tuning. <br><br>Last but not least, we've got Finger Guns with an 80, saying Paper Trail is \"a great entry\" into the puzzle genre. They love the game's ever-folding world and wonderful visuals, even if the story is a bit... meh.<br><br>And finally, GAMINGbible drops in with a 90, calling Paper Trail \"simple yet complex\" (or something like that). They say it elicits emotions all via the simple art of virtual origami, and I'm just here for the origami puns!<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, let me put it this way: if you're looking for a game that'll fold your heart in half with its adorable animations, whimsical world, and addictive puzzles, then Paper Trail is the game for you! Just don't forget to bring some tissues (you know, for all those feels).",
