And, honestly, I'm not exactly the most patient person when it comes to puzzle games (hello, instant gratification!). But, surprise, surprise - Paper Trail won me over with its charm and wit.<br><br>Now, let's see what some other critics have to say about this game:<br><br>Metro GameCentral gave it a respectable 70, saying that the game has just enough intricacy to keep you engaged without feeling stuck. Push Square also scored it an 80, praising its charming design and unique puzzle mechanic. PlayStation Universe was a bit more effusive, giving it a 95 for its passion and mastery of craft.<br><br>But what about the rest? Well, GameSpew thought the puzzles could be tiresome, scoring it a 70. PlayStation Country gave it an 80, saying it's a fine puzzle game with a lovely origami mechanic. Softpedia scored it a 75, praising its soulful gameplay and immersion. And Finger Guns? Yep, they gave it an 80 too, calling it a great entry into the puzzle genre.<br><br>So, what's my take on Paper Trail? Well, I think it's a delightful game that'll appeal to fans of puzzle-adventures. The origami mechanic is cleverly designed, and the visuals are simply stunning (I mean, have you seen those paper folding animations?!). The story might not be as strong as some other games out there, but it's still sweet and endearing.<br><br>In conclusion, Paper Trail is a charming game that'll keep you engaged with its unique puzzle mechanic and gorgeous visuals. If you're a fan of puzzles or just looking for something new to try, this game is definitely worth your time!<br><br>(And, honestly, if I were to score it... well, let's just say I'd give it a score that would make the other critics green with envy!)",
