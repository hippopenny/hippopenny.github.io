Push Square gave it an 80% score, praising the unique puzzle mechanic and sweet coming-of-age tale. PlayStation Universe raved about its passion and mastery of craft, while GameSpew was a bit more mixed, saying that the puzzles can grow tiresome.<br><br>But let's get to my take on Paper Trail! First off, the art is GORGEOUS - I mean, who doesn't love hand-drawn visuals? The world is whimsical, beautifully atmospheric, and just begging to be explored. And those puzzles? Challenging in a good way, like trying to fold a fitted sheet without losing your mind (has anyone else ever had that experience? .<br><br>Sofpedia gave it 75%, saying that while the story is interesting enough, the gameplay will keep you invested. And I have to agree - once you get hooked on solving those puzzles, it's hard to stop! The soundtrack might be a bit repetitive, but who am I kidding? It's still a fairy tale come true.<br><br>Finger Guns gave Paper Trail an 80% score, praising its perfect implementation of the ever-folding world and wonderful visuals. And GAMINGbible took it even further, giving it a whopping 90%! They said it's a charming game that elicits complex human emotions - I couldn't agree more!<br><br>So, is Paper Trail worth your time? Absolutely! It's a unique, challenging, and beautifully crafted puzzle game that will keep you hooked. And hey, who knows? You might even learn some origami skills along the way (just don't try to fold a fitted sheet).",
