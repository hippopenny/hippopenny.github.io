But before I get started, let me just say that I'm not exactly the next big thing in gaming journalism. I mean, have you seen my review header? It's Hippo Penny! Yeah, I know, real original, right?<br><br>Okay, okay, let's get to the good stuff! Paper Trail has been making waves among critics, and I'm excited to share my two cents (or should I say, my two folds?). Here are some quotes from the big names:<br><br>Push Square says it's \"a charming game with an interesting and unique puzzle mechanic.\" Yay, agreeable!<br><br>PlayStation Universe raves about the game's passion and mastery of craft. Ah, flattery will get you everywhere!<br><br>GameSpew finds the puzzles to be an acquired taste (read: meh). Boo, GameSpew! Where's your sense of adventure?<br><br>Sofpedia loves the narrative and gameplay blend, while Finger Guns thinks it's a great entry into puzzle gaming. Hey, I'm glad someone likes my puns!<br><br>GAMINGbible goes full-on fanboy mode, gushing about the game's complexity and charm. Okay, okay, I'll stop poking fun at myself now...<br><br>So, what's Paper Trail all about? It's a top-down puzzler where you fold and slide paper to solve levels. Simple premise, but oh so delightfully challenging! The game world is gorgeous, with hand-drawn art that's almost too pretty to play on (almost).<br><br>I won't bore you with the nitty-gritty details (except for the soundtrack, which gets a bit repetitive). Suffice it to say that Paper Trail is an absolute treat. It's like solving origami puzzles, minus the risk of turning your fingers into squished, paper-like things .<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a lighthearted puzzle-adventure with some serious charm, look no further than Paper Trail! (Just don't ask me to do any actual origami; my folding skills are, shall we say, \"acquired\".",
