Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Origami? Really? That sounds so... basic.\" But trust me, friends, this game will fold (heh) your expectations in more ways than one.<br><br>First off, let's talk graphics. The art in Paper Trail is straight-up stunning - think hand-drawn illustrations that'll make you feel like you're stepping into a whimsical fairy tale. And the soundtrack? Oh boy, it's as atmospheric and beautiful as the visuals. You might find yourself getting lost in this world (pun intended).<br><br>Now, onto those puzzles! They can be a bit tricky to get used to at first, but once you grasp the concept of folding and unfolding paper to solve problems, you'll be hooked. The game does a great job of introducing new mechanics gradually, so you won't feel overwhelmed.<br><br>What I love most about Paper Trail is its unique blend of simplicity and depth. On the surface, it seems like a simple puzzle game, but as you delve deeper, you'll discover that there's a lot more to it. The story, while not necessarily groundbreaking, has a certain charm to it, and you'll find yourself invested in Paige's journey.<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without some (gentle) teasing of our fellow critics. I mean, who wouldn't want to give this game 95 points out of 100? That's like giving the entire origami community a collective high-five!<br><br>All jokes aside, Paper Trail is an indie gem that's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of puzzles and whimsical worlds. So go ahead, fold (okay, I'll stop now), and get ready to be charmed by this delightful little game!",
