    "comment": "Hippo Penny! Let me tell you, Paper Trail is one heck of a puzzle game. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Paper folding? Really?\" But hear me out, folks! This game is more than just folding paper (although, let's be real, that's half the fun). It's an immersive experience that'll keep you guessing and grinning from ear to ear.<br><br>Now, I've seen some critics say this game is all about the visuals - and don't get me wrong, those hand-drawn art style is purr-fectly gorgeous. But let's not forget the gameplay! The puzzles are cleverly designed, requiring just the right amount of strategy and creativity to solve. And that perspective-shifting mechanic? Mind-blowing! You'll be folding and unfolding paper like a pro in no time.<br><br>Now, I know some critics might say this game is too repetitive or tiresome (ahem, GameSpew), but trust me, folks - the repetition is what makes it so addictive. You'll find yourself wanting to just one more level, and then another... before you know it, hours have passed! <br><br>Of course, I have to give a shout-out to GAMINGbible for being blown away by this game (I mean, who wouldn't be?!). And Push Square's review is spot on - the story might not reach emotional highs, but that atmospheric soundtrack makes up for it.<br><br>Now, don't even get me started on PlayStation Universe's glowing review. I mean, those words are music to my ears! But let's just say... some critics might not be as convinced (cough, Metro GameCentral, cough). Oh well, to each their own!<br><br>In the end, Paper Trail is a game that will charm you with its whimsical world and inventive puzzles. It's an indie gem that deserves attention from puzzle fans everywhere! So go ahead, give it a try - just don't say I didn't warn you when you get sucked in for hours on end...",
