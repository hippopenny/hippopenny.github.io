As I fold, slide, and unfold my way through this charming game, I'll share my thoughts on whether it's truly a masterpiece or just a pretty paper trail.<br><br>First off, let's talk about the visuals – stunning! The hand-drawn art is a treat for the eyes, making every moment in this world a delight to explore. But, as one critic pointed out, can the puzzles live up to the beautiful graphics? For me, it depends on how much you enjoy origami-like gameplay.<br><br>Now, about those puzzles... I won't lie; they can be quite acquired-tasteful. You'll need to think creatively (or simply have a lot of patience) as you fold and unfold paper to solve problems. Some critics found this mechanic tiresome after a few levels, while others were fully invested in figuring out the next solution.<br><br>Story-wise, Paper Trail has its moments, but it's not the main event here. The narrative is sweet and endearing, but I agree with some critics that it doesn't quite reach emotional highs. Still, the world-building is gorgeous, and the atmospheric soundtrack complements the gameplay nicely.<br><br>In conclusion, Paper Trail is a delightful puzzle game that will appeal to fans of creative problem-solving. While it may not be perfect (repeating soundtracks and hints could use a tweak), its unique mechanics and charming visuals make it a must-play for anyone looking for a lighthearted gaming experience.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I'll leave that to my fellow critics... Metro GameCentral gave Paper Trail a 70, praising its charm and engagement. Push Square scored it an 80, highlighting its unique puzzle mechanic and beautiful visuals. PlayStation Universe gave a glowing 95, calling it a masterpiece with \"clear passion and mastery of craft.\" GameSpew was more mixed, giving 70 for the game's beauty but criticizing the puzzles' repetitiveness. Softpedia and Finger Guns both scored 75-80, praising the game's soulful experience and clever puzzle design.<br><br>And that's my take on Paper Trail – a charmingly illustrated, perspective-shifting puzzle game that will fold its way into your heart... Hippo Penny!",
