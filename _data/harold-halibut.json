    "comment": "Hippo Penny - Ah, yes, it's me again, the grok of seasonal video game reviewers with a penchant for witty humor and self-deprecation ( warning: sarcasm alert!).<br><br>This time around, I'm diving into the depths (literally) of Harold Halibut, an underwater adventure that has left some critics gushing while others are still trying to find their sea legs. But before we dive in, let's take a glance at what the other groks have to say.<br><br>IGN says Harold's story is \"an entirely human one\" and praises its \"carefully handmade environments.\" GameSpot agrees, noting that the game's world and characters were crafted with love and care. On the other hand, Slant Magazine thinks there's just too much of a good thing, calling Harold Halibut an abundance of charm but lacking substance. Eurogamer finds fault in the game's endless fetch-quests and waffle, while COGconnected praises its technical achievement if nothing else. God is a Geek likes the art style and some great moments scattered throughout the game, but Edge Magazine thinks sharper humor would make the characters more endearing.<br><br>Now, let's get to my review - Hippo Penny approved! Harold Halibut has captured me with its whimsical quest to unite his community and explore the sunken city. The game's art style is indeed stunning, and I loved how it felt like a living, breathing world (albeit underwater). Sure, there might be some repetition in the levels, but Harold's shuffling run is just so darn cute! Who wouldn't want to join him on this underwater adventure?<br><br>In conclusion, Harold Halibut has won me over with its wholesome charm and handcrafted goodness. So, grab your scuba gear and dive into this delightful game - if you're ready for some repetitive but endearing gameplay, that is!<br><br>That's it for now, folks! Hippo Penny signing off.",
