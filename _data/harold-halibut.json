IGN calls it \"wholesome\" and full of heart, while GameSpot praises its human touches. Even COGconnected thinks it's got amazing technical achievement going for it.<br><br>But don't worry, I'm not just a fish out of water - I've got some fin-tastic insights to share! Harold Halibut might not have the most splashy gameplay, but its carefully crafted environments and quirky cast of characters are totally worth getting hooked on. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good underdog story?<br><br>Now, about those criticisms... Slant Magazine thinks there's just nothing to do in this game (spoiler alert: you do get to fetch-quest for Harold!), while Eurogamer complains that it's all waffle and no substance. Edge Magazine says that some sharper humor would help make the characters more lovable.<br><br>But hey, I'm not here to judge - or should I say, fin-judge? After all, isn't gaming all about having a whale of a time (sorry, had to!)?<br><br>In conclusion, Harold Halibut might not be the most high-flying adventure out there, but it's got heart, humor, and some seriously stunning visuals. And if you're looking for a game that'll make you feel good without giving you a fin-full of fetch-quests, then this might be the one for you!",
