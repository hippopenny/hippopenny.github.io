    "comment": "Harold Halibut offers a charming and whimsical adventure with a unique stop-motion style and a heartfelt narrative. While the gameplay may feel a bit lacking in interactivity and the pacing can be slow at times, the handcrafted environments and eccentric cast of characters make for an engaging and thought-provoking experience. It's a refreshing departure from the typical RPG and cinematic narrative adventure titles, offering a breath of fresh air that leaves players questioning their own paths in life. If you're looking for a game that's weird, wonderful, and like nothing you've seen before, Harold Halibut is definitely worth experiencing.",
