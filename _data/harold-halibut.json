Welcome back to my humble abode of game reviews where I promise not to be as cringeworthy as some of the critics out there (cough, cough, Slant Magazine).<br><br>Harold Halibut is a peculiar fellow. A gofer, if you will, living in a sunken alien planet at the bottom of the ocean. Who wouldn't want to explore that? But seriously, Harold's world and its eccentric cast of characters are where the game truly shines. It's like a warm hug on a cold day.<br><br>Now, I'm not here to give you a play-by-play analysis of Harold's quest (I'll leave that for those fancy-pants critics). What I will do is share my own experience playing this charming adventure. And let me tell you, it's all about the whimsy! From navigating Harold's adorable shuffling run (think of a gofer-sized Yoshi) to discovering hidden secrets and surprises in the game's vast environments, you'll be grinning from ear to ear.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! Let's see what some of the big-name critics have to say. IGN gives Harold Halibut an impressive 80, calling it a \"wholesome, handcrafted adventure with plenty of heart.\" Meanwhile, GameSpot awards it a solid 70, praising the game's \"human touches\" and the way its world is \"literally crafted by people that cared about him and his story.\"<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, Slant Magazine thinks Harold Halibut falls flat at just 50. They claim there's \"nothing to do,\" which makes me wonder: have they ever played a game without a single fetch-quest? Just kidding (kind of).<br><br>Eurogamer gives us a lukewarm 60, saying Harold flounders amidst endless quests and... waffle? I'm not sure what kind of waffle they're talking about, but it sounds like a real party.<br><br>COGconnected chimes in with an 78, admiring the game's \"amazing technical achievement\" and its coherent narrative. And God is a Geek agrees, giving Harold Halibut a score of 70 for having some great moments (despite taking a while to get going).<br><br>Lastly, Edge Magazine brings us down to earth with a 50, saying sharper humor would make the game more endearing. Ouch!<br><br>In conclusion, Harold Halibut is an adventure that will capture your heart, if not always challenge your brain. It's a world of whimsy, full of surprises and lovable characters. Just don't expect too much interactivity or Harold's run to turn into a sprint anytime soon.<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Dive on in and discover the wonders of Harold Halibut!",
