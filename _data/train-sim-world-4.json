    "comment": "All aboard the Train Sim World 4! While the game does a great job with the train simulation, it falls short on the world aspect. With only three base game routes and pricey DLCs, the world of Train Sim World 4 feels a bit limited. However, if you're a train enthusiast with lots of sim cash to spare, this game will keep you chugging along. Dovetail Games has certainly mastered the art of train driving, but it's time for them to expand their horizons and take us on exhilarating journeys beyond North America and Europe. Despite the lack of diverse content, Train Sim World 4 still reigns as the king of the rails, offering an endless supply of train-tastic adventures.",
