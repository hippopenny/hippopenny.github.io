    "comment": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong offers an engaging narrative adventure set in the World of Darkness, although it suffers from some technical issues and pacing problems. With a focus on player choice and detective work, the game delivers interesting puzzles and a vampire-fueled mystery that will keep you engaged. However, the unimpressive presentation and lackluster characters may hinder the overall experience. Despite its flaws, Swansong is worth sinking your teeth into for fans of the tabletop game looking for a different take on the vampire genre.",
