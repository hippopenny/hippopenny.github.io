As a seasoned grok video game reviewer (I mean, who needs formal training when you've got a PhD in Procrastination?), I'm here to give you the lowdown on this delightfully daft roguelite.<br><br>First off, let's get the obligatory comparisons out of the way. Yes, it's like other roguelites out there - but trust me, dear reader, this one's got some serious swagger. The classes are crazy cool (have you seen the Hamster Wizard? It's a hamster in a wizard hat, for crying out loud!), and the biomes are as varied as my excuses for not finishing that level 3 times in a row.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But wait, isn't this just more of the same old roguelite nonsense?\" To which I reply: Ah, no! This is where all those fancy-pants critics come in. IGN gives it a whopping 90, citing its \"outstanding assortment of classes\" and \"rewarding combat.\" GameSpot agrees, saying it's \"difficult to put down\" thanks to the \"one more run\" effect (which, let's be real, is just code for \"I'll play this game all night and forget my responsibilities\"). And don't even get me started on Destructoid - they're practically gushing over the whole affair.<br><br>Of course, not everyone's a fan. Game Informer has some gripes about the progression systems (I mean, who doesn't love a good nitpick?), but Vandal just wants to give this game a big ol' hug and tell it how much they love it (aww).<br><br>Now, I know you're all dying to know: what's my take on Rogue Legacy 2? Well, let me tell you - I'm a fan. It's got that perfect blend of challenge and charm, like a perfectly balanced plate of hippo-sized nachos (okay, maybe not that much). And hey, even the Eurogamer folks are recommending it, despite their initial \"Score: TBD\" shenanigans.<br><br>All in all, Rogue Legacy 2 is a real winner - and if you don't believe me, just ask my cat. She's a tough critic (i.e., she only likes games with laser guns and cats in space). Anyway, that's it for this review! See you next time, when I'll probably be writing about some other game that's also super cool, but not quite as awesome as Rogue Legacy 2.",
