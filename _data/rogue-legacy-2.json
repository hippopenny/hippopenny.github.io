I'm still reeling from the high scores these critics gave, but let's get to the good stuff - how does this roguelite hold up under scrutiny?<br><br>First off, IGN called it a \"premiere roguelite\" thanks to its diverse areas and combat. GameSpot chimed in with their own praise, saying it's \"difficult to put down.\" Meanwhile, Game Informer noted that despite some minor gripes, every new discovery felt like a deep satisfaction.<br><br>These glowing reviews have me wondering: what's the magic behind Rogue Legacy 2? For starters, the game offers a slew of classes to choose from, each with its own unique weapons and playstyle. This adds a whole new layer of replayability, as you can experiment with different strategies and find the one that suits your gaming style.<br><br>But even beyond the initial run, there's plenty to keep you coming back for more. House Rules allow you to tailor the challenge to your liking, whether you want to make things easier or harder. And when all else fails, sacrificing your family tree has never felt so good (just kidding, it's actually pretty sad).<br><br>So, what's not to love? Well, some critics noted that the game can be a bit too repetitive at times, with backtracking becoming an issue as you search for the path forward. But honestly, this is just nitpicking - Rogue Legacy 2 is a fantastic game that's hard to put down.<br><br>Destructoid gave it a perfect score, saying it's one of their favorite roguelite games. And Eurogamer Italy agreed, calling it the \"perfect sequel\" to an already brilliant formula. Even Eurogamer themselves were impressed, recommending it without hesitation (although they didn't give a specific score).<br><br>All in all, Rogue Legacy 2 is a must-play for any fan of roguelites and metroidvania games. With its diverse areas, rewarding combat, and plethora of classes and House Rules to explore, you'll be hooked from start to finish.<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Go give it a try - and don't forget to sacrifice your family tree (just kidding again).",
