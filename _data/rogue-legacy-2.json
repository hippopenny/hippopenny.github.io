Okay, fine, maybe not \"many others\" since my friends and family think I've lost all sense of reality due to the constant stream of \"just one more run\" notifications on my phone.<br><br>Seriously though, this game is a masterclass in game design. Cellar Door Games has outdone themselves (or should I say, their ancestors?) with an addictive roguelike experience that's as beautiful as it is challenging.<br><br>Let's talk about the praise-worthy aspects. The world of Rogue Legacy 2 is stunning - vibrant, colorful, and full of wonder. Each biome feels like a new discovery, whether it's the eerie darkness of the caves or the sun-drenched beauty of the forest. And then there are the classes! Oh boy, do I love experimenting with different heir choices to see how they shape the gameplay experience.<br><br>But what truly sets Rogue Legacy 2 apart is its ability to balance challenge and replayability. Sure, it's not for everyone (I mean, I've died... a lot), but when you finally reach that \"aha!\" moment where everything clicks into place, it's pure bliss. And don't even get me started on the House Rules - having control over difficulty is like being the game master of your own destiny.<br><br>Of course, not everyone shares my enthusiasm (I mean, Edge Magazine, what's with the 70? Did you miss the memo about this game being a masterpiece?). Some critics have noted that the game can be overwhelming, but I think that's just part of its charm. The sheer scope of possibilities and pathways to explore is intoxicating.<br><br>All in all, Rogue Legacy 2 is a must-play for anyone who loves roguelikes or Metroidvanias (or both!). It's a testament to the power of game design when even us critics can't get enough. So go ahead, give it a try - but don't say I didn't warn you about the \"just one more run\" syndrome...",
