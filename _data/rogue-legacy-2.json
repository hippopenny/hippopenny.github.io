I mean, who wouldn't want to play a game that's essentially the ultimate \"one more run\" experience? You'll be hooked, folks - just ask IGN, GameSpot, Game Informer, Vandal, or Destructoid! *nods* <br><br>Okay, so what makes Rogue Legacy 2 so darn special? For starters, the classes. Oh man, the classes! Each one has its unique set of skills and abilities that'll keep you experimenting and trying new things. The combat is satisfyingly punishing, too - just ask Eurogamer Italy! *winks* And let's not forget about those House Rules, which allow you to tailor the challenge to your liking (or increase it for a greater sense of accomplishment). It's like they took all the best parts of the original and amplified them!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, what about the backtracking in some biomes?\" Well, let me put it this way - it's a minor blemish on an otherwise fantastic game. Think of it as a minor speed bump on your journey to becoming the ultimate Rogue Legacy 2 champion!<br><br>In conclusion, if you haven't already, go ahead and join the ranks of those critics who are raving about Rogue Legacy 2! *laughs* It's a wild ride that'll keep you entertained for hours (or days, or weeks... you get the idea). And hey, even Eurogamer, with their \"tbd\" score, can't help but recommend it!<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Get ready to sacrifice your family tree (just kidding - or am I?) and dive into the wonderful world of Rogue Legacy 2!",
