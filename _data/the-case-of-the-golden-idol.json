Now, I know what you're thinking - another detective game, yawn. But trust me, this one's got some serious sleuthing skills.<br><br>First off, let's get the positives out of the way. This game is like a Sherlockian dream come true. The puzzles are inventive, the art direction is excellent (think: stylishly simple), and the storyline is actually decent. I mean, who doesn't love a good whodunit? It's like they took all the best parts of an Agatha Christie novel and put 'em in a video game.<br><br>Now, about those reviewers. Guardian gave it a perfect score, saying it's \"genuinely new and inventive forms of play\" - yawn, I mean, wow. Game Rant was hot on their heels with a 90% review, calling it \"uniquely clever\" and \"full of wonderful idiosyncrasies\". Yeah, no kidding.<br><br>But don't worry, I'm not here to just fawn over the critics' reviews. Oh no, I've got some fun facts for you! Did you know that PC Gamer called it a \"challenging and inventive set of mysteries\"? Or that Multiplayer.it said it was \"a brilliant and original detective point & click adventure\"? Yeah, I know, it's like they're trying to convince me or something.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong, even the harshest critics had some nice things to say. Edge Magazine gave it a solid 80% review, saying the conclusion is satisfying (no pun intended). And Metro GameCentral just plain loved it, calling it \"another great indie detective game\".<br><br>But what about Adventure Gamers, you ask? Well, let's just say they were a bit more...grumpy. They gave it a 60%, saying the narrative was frustratingly executed and the presentation was unremarkable. Ouch.<br><br>In conclusion, The Case of the Golden Idol is like that one friend who always knows how to make you laugh - except instead of jokes, they're solving murders. It's got some minor flaws, but overall, it's a delightful game that'll keep you guessing till the very end. And if you don't believe me, just ask Hippo Penny (that's me).",
