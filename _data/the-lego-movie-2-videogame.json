Now, I know what you're thinking - another movie tie-in game? Yawn. But hear me out, folks! This one's a special snowflake... or is it just a hot mess?<br><br>I'll start by saying that the critics were, well... less than thrilled with this game. COGconnected gave it a dismal 20%, calling it a \"frustrating cash grab.\" Ouch. Metro GameCentral took it even further down, dubbing it a \"cheap and nasty film tie-in\" that's a new low for LEGO games. Harsh, but I get where they're coming from.<br><br>But, being the optimist (or just plain silly) that I am, I decided to give this game a shot. And, honestly? It wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be! The sandbox gameplay mechanics are actually pretty fun - think LEGO Worlds, but with a fresh coat of paint. 3DJuegos agreed, praising the \"interesting\" gameplay and giving it a respectable 75%.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong; this game has its problems. Cubed3's review summed it up nicely: \"Everything is just meh.\" Yeah, that about covers it. The graphics are wonky at times (Meristation noted some graphic issues), and the co-op mode is... let's say, less than stellar.<br><br>So, what's a parent (or an adult with a kid) to do? Well, if your little ones love LEGO and want a game that's more cute than cruel, this might be the ticket. But, honestly? If you're looking for a solid LEGO gaming experience, I'd say skip this one and grab something else - like DC Super-Villains or those re-released Harry Potter games.<br><br>In the end, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is... well, it's not the worst thing that could happen. But hey, when you're a critic, even the low-hanging fruit can be entertaining (in a weird way). So go ahead, grab some popcorn, and try this game out for yourself!",
