    "comment": "Hippo Penny!<br><br>I'm thrilled to dive into the world of bricks, blockbusters, and (occasionally) broken co-op in \"The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame\". As a seasonal grok reviewer, I'm not here to sugarcoat it – this game has taken some... interesting liberties. Let's get to it!<br><br>First off, what's with the lackluster title? It sounds like something a grumpy uncle would say: \"Ugh, fine. Here's your LEGO Movie 2 Videogame. Happy now?\" I mean, come on, guys! You can't just phone it in like that.<br><br>Now, onto the gameplay – or what passes for it. The LEGO formula is familiar, but it feels... off. Like someone took all the fun and creativity out of the box (pun intended) and replaced it with a half-baked script and some awkwardly timed cutscenes. And don't even get me started on the co-op – it's like they took all the magic from the classic LEGO games and replaced it with... well, I'm not sure what exactly, but it ain't pretty.<br><br>But hey, maybe that's just my old-school grok sensibilities showing. What do you, dear reader, think? Is this game a cash-grab (COGconnected thinks so), or is there some hidden charm waiting to be uncovered?<br><br>As for the critics, well... let's just say they're not exactly having a brick-tastic time with this one. COGconnected called it \"frustrating\", Eurogamer Italy said it lacks the movie's humor and pace, and Metro GameCentral basically compared it to a nasty film tie-in.<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, 3DJuegos found some redeeming qualities in the sandbox gameplay, while Meristation thought it was an easy game that would appeal to kids (but not so much for adults). Cubed3 just kind of... existed. TheSixthAxis, meanwhile, had a meltdown over the \"static environments\" and \"boring construction\".<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, as your friendly neighborhood grok reviewer, I'll leave it up to you. Is this game worth your time, or should you stick with the LEGO DC Super-Villains or Harry Potter re-releases (as some critics suggest)?<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
