And let me tell you, this game is... well, it's a mixed bag.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Why are we even talking about a LEGO movie tie-in?\" Well, my friends, sometimes these cash-grabs can surprise us (in a good or bad way). So, let's get to the fun stuff! What do our fellow critics think of this game?<br><br>First off, COGconnected seems like the grumpiest reviewer ever. They call it a \"frustrating cash grab\" and say that it feels like LEGO Worlds with less humor and pace. Ouch! I mean, come on, who doesn't love a good LEGO Worlds? Okay, maybe not Metro GameCentral, who thinks this game is a \"new low for Lego games.\" Harsh, dude!<br><br>On the other hand, 3DJuegos seems to be having a groovy time with this game. They praise its sandbox gameplay mechanics and say it refreshes the over-used LEGO formula. Now that's what I'm talking about! A good ol' fashioned LEGO party.<br><br>But let's not forget Cubed3, who says everything is just... meh. And honestly, I kinda get where they're coming from. The game does feel like a shell of its former self, with some wonky graphics and lackluster co-op. Maybe it's just not the right vibe for everyone.<br><br>So, what about my own take on this game? Well, let's just say that Hippo Penny has had better days playing LEGO games (remember that awesome Harry Potter game?). The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is a bit of a disappointment, but hey, maybe I'm just too old to appreciate the kiddie charm.<br><br>In conclusion, this game is like a box of LEGOs: it's got some great pieces, but you might need to dig through the rubble to find the fun. If you're a young'un (like me, in spirit), you might enjoy the sandbox gameplay and colorful visuals. But if you're an old pro like me, you might find yourself saying, \"Everything is not awesome...\" Sorry, had to!<br><br>That's it for my review of The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame! Stay groovy, gamers!",
