It's like they took all the fun, creativity, and charm of the original LEGO games and replaced it with a bland, uninspired cash grab.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"But [Your Name], what about COGconnected? They gave it a score of 20!\" Yeah, okay, COGconnected, you're harshing my mellow. I mean, I get it, game development is hard, but come on! This feels like a rushed job, like they phoned it in and just hoped no one would notice.<br><br>And don't even get me started on Eurogamer Italy's review - \"it looks like a LEGO World reskin\"?! That's not a criticism, that's a compliment! The original LEGO games were all about building and exploring, and this game does just that. But I guess when you're trying to cash in on a popular movie franchise, you gotta try harder.<br><br>But wait, it gets worse! Metro GameCentral says it's \"a cheap and nasty film tie-in\"?! That's harsh, man. I mean, I've played some bad games before, but this one takes the cake (or should I say, the LEGO brick?).<br><br>On the bright side, 3DJuegos seems to think it's got some interesting sandbox gameplay mechanics. And Meristation says it's perfect for kids! So if you're looking for a game to entertain your tiny humans, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame might be the way to go.<br><br>But let's not forget Cubed3's review - \"everything is just meh\". Ouch, that hurts. I mean, who wants to play a game that's just...meh? It's like playing with blocks without the fun of actually building something cool.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, I won't leave you hanging - it's not all bad! The graphics are nice, and the characters are cute (even if they do look like they came straight from a LEGO World reskin). But overall, this game is just...meh. It's a missed opportunity to create something special, something that would really capture the essence of the movie.<br><br>In conclusion, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is a bit of a letdown. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. If you're looking for a good LEGO game, I'd recommend checking out some of the other titles in the series - like DC Super-Villains or the re-release of Harry Potter games.<br><br>But hey, if you're looking for a game to play with your kids, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame might be the way to go. Just don't expect too much from it, and you won't be disappointed.",
