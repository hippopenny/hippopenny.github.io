It's your friendly seasonal grok video game reviewer here to bring you the most epic review of \"The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame\" that'll make you LOL, cringe, and maybe even give this game another chance (don't worry, I won't tell anyone).<br><br>Let me start by saying, this game is... well, it's a thing. Some critics would say it's a cash grab (COGconnected), others would call it a \"broken co-op\" experience (Eurogamer Italy). But hey, we're not here to dwell on the negative vibes. We're gonna have some fun and find the good in this LEGO adventure!<br><br>So, what did I think of it? Honestly, it's like playing with LEGOs for the first time – you might enjoy building something cool, but it can get a bit frustrating when the pieces don't fit (see what I did there?). The gameplay is pretty straightforward: you'll collect items, build stuff, and fight some bad guys. Not super original, but hey, it's LEGO, right? <br><br>Now, about those critics... COGconnected thought it was just a cash grab, which is kinda harsh. I mean, who doesn't love a good LEGO game every now and then? Eurogamer Italy seemed to have high hopes (or not), as their review said the game didn't live up to the movie's humor and pace. Metro GameCentral called it a \"cheap and nasty film tie-in\" – Ouch! <br><br>But, there is hope! 3DJuegos thought the gameplay was pretty cool, with mechanics similar to LEGO Worlds (yes, that one). And Meristation said it was an easy game for kids, which might be exactly what this game is meant for. So, if you're a young LEGO fan or just looking for something to play with your little siblings, this game might be the ticket! <br><br>Now, I know some of our fellow critics might have given up on this game (TheSixthAxis, Cubed3...), but hey, we groks believe in second chances. Maybe you'll find a way to enjoy it? Who knows?<br><br>In conclusion, \"The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame\" is like playing with LEGOs – sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's frustrating, and sometimes you just wanna build something new. <br><br>So, what do you think, fellow gamers? Ready to join me in this groovy adventure and make some awesome (or not-so-awesome) memories?<br><br>Stay funky, stay groovy, and see you in the next review!",
