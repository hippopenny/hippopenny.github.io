It's your boy Grok here, back with another review that'll make you laugh, cry (just kidding, not cry), and maybe even make you want to play the game (or not). Today, I'm tackling the LEGO Movie 2 Videogame, because, well, someone has to.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, why should I care about your review when there are so many other critics out there telling me how awful this game is?\" Well, my friends, that's where my witty humor comes in. Let me tell you, some of these critics have been RUFF (get it? like a LEGO brick, but also rough... okay, moving on).<br><br>Take COGconnected, for example. They gave the game a low score and said it was \"a frustrating cash grab.\" Ouch, that stings! But hey, I'm not here to argue with COGconnected's scoring methods (although, let me tell you, their review does sound like they were having a pretty bad day).<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, we have 3DJuegos, who gave it a decent score and said the game has \"interesting sandbox gameplay mechanics.\" Now, I'm not saying that's true or false, but it does make me want to play the game (if only to see if those mechanics are as cool as they sound).<br><br>The rest of the critics fall somewhere in between. Eurogamer Italy said it was a boring reskin of LEGO Worlds, while Cubed3 called it \"heavily flawed\" and said it felt like something a LEPIN (get it? LEGO-PIN... yeah, I know, moving on again). And Meristation just kind of shrugged and said it's an easy game for kids, but not so much for adults. Zzz...<br><br>So, what does this mean for me? Well, I'm a seasonal critic, which means I only care about the latest LEGO games (just kidding... sort of). In all seriousness, I think the real question is: are you tired of hearing everyone else's opinions and just want to form your own?<br><br>If that's the case, then strap in, Buttercup! I'm about to give you my honest take on The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame (spoiler alert: it's not as bad as some people make it out to be).<br><br>Stay tuned for my review, where I'll put on my big boy pants and tell it like it is (or at least, try to).",
