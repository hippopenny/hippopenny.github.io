I must admit, my expectations were a tad low after reading those scathing reviews from other critics (I'll get to those later). But hey, I'm all about giving games a fair chance, just like President Business would (oh wait, that's the joke).<br><br>So, what did I think of this brick-tastic adventure? Well, let me tell you – it's not as bad as everyone made it out to be! The game's got its charm, and the sandbox gameplay is surprisingly fun. You get to build all sorts of crazy contraptions using LEGO bricks, which is, of course, a major highlight.<br><br>But here's the thing: the critics were right about some aspects. The co-op mode does feel a bit broken, and the graphics could be better. And let's not forget the repetitive missions – I mean, how many times can you rescue the same LEGO minifigure before it gets old?<br><br>Still, I think some of my fellow critics were being too harsh. I mean, come on, it's a LEGO game! It's meant to be fun and silly, not a serious gaming experience. And hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned LEGO brick-packing session? (Okay, maybe the folks at COGconnected did).<br><br>In all seriousness, if you're a fan of the LEGO series or just looking for a lighthearted game to play with your little ones, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame might be worth a try. Just don't expect it to win any awards for graphical prowess or innovative gameplay mechanics.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about those other critics?\" Well, let's just say I think some of them got a bit carried away with their negativity. I mean, COGconnected called it a \"frustrating cash grab\"? Really? It's a LEGO game! Cubed3 said it was \"not even okay\"? Okay, maybe that one is a bit too harsh.<br><br>Eurogamer Italy did have some valid points about the lack of humor and pace, but hey, that's what makes The LEGO Movie so great – its humor and pace are all wrong (just kidding, they're perfect). And 3DJuegos got it right; the sandbox gameplay mechanics are actually quite fun!<br><br>Meristation mentioned graphic issues, which I didn't experience myself, but maybe that's just my gaming setup. As for TheSixthAxis... well, let's just say their review was a bit too President Business-y (ba-dum-tss).<br><br>So there you have it – my Hippo Penny review of The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame! It's not perfect, but it's a fun little game that'll keep your inner child entertained. And hey, who knows? Maybe one day they'll make a LEGO game that's actually as awesome as the movie (just kidding, they already did – see: LEGO Batman).",
