Critics have been piling on with some harsh words, and I'm here to give you my two cents (or should I say, my two LEGO bricks?).<br><br>First off, let's get the bad news out of the way - this game is getting roasted by many outlets. COGconnected calls it a \"fascinating cash grab,\" while Metro GameCentral says it reaches a new low for LEGO games. Ouch! Even 3DJuegos, which gave it a relatively high score of 75, seems to imply that it's not the most exciting game in the franchise.<br><br>But what about the good stuff? Well, I've got some fun news - despite being a bit of a mess, this game still has some redeeming qualities! Cubed3's review mentions that TT Games has finally done something different with the LEGO formula (even if it is flawed), and Meristation notes that children will love it.<br><br>So, what does it all mean? Well, I think it's safe to say that The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame isn't exactly the best representation of the franchise. It feels like a cheap, uninspired reskin of LEGO Worlds (which, let's be real, is already a step down from the good old days of LEGO games).<br><br>But hey, if you're a parent looking for a fun game to play with your little ones, this might just do the trick! And who knows - maybe it'll even bring back some fond memories of playing with those beloved LEGO bricks as a kid.<br><br>All in all, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is a bit of a mixed bag. It's not the worst thing I've ever played (I'm looking at you, GameCube edition of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed), but it's definitely not the best. If you're a hardcore LEGO fan, you might be disappointed. But if you're just looking for some mindless fun with your kiddos, this could be a decent way to spend an afternoon.<br><br>And hey, who knows - maybe future updates will make it less of a mess! After all, even President Business can't resist the power of the LEGO bricks (although, let's be real, if he designed this game, we'd probably all be in trouble).",
