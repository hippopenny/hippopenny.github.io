It's time to get this party started with a review of The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame!<br><br>As I booted up the game, I couldn't help but think about all the other critics who've already given it the old \"LEGO-GETTING-DUMPED\" treatment. COGconnected, you know who you are... calling it a cash grab? Eurogamer Italy, you're not alone in thinking it's just a rehash of LEGO Worlds?<br><br>But hey, I'm here to bring some fun back into the mix! I dove in, brick by brick, and found that The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame has its moments. The sandbox gameplay mechanics are actually pretty cool - kind of like LEGO World, but without the need for a separate game purchase.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Is it as bad as Cubed3 says?\" Well, let me tell you, everything isn't awful (thank goodness). 3DJuegos was right on the money when they said the interesting sandbox gameplay refreshes the over-used LEGO formula. And hey, if you're a kid, Meristation is spot on - this game is perfect for little builders in training!<br><br>But don't get me wrong, folks! This game isn't exactly The Sixth Axis's cup of tea (read: it's as dull as they say). President Business would probably approve, but I won't lie, the graphics issues and static environments got on my nerves a bit.<br><br>In conclusion, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is... meh. It's not the best, it's not the worst - it just exists. If you're a fan of the franchise or looking for something to play with the kiddos, you might find some enjoyment here. But if you're expecting a game that will blow your mind (or even make you chuckle), keep on searching.<br><br>And hey, don't worry about those other critics; I'm sure they were just having a bad brick day...<br><br>See you in the next review!",
