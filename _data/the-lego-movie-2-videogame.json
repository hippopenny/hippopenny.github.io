Get ready to rumble...or rather, get ready to groan at the mediocre mess that is The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame!<br><br>Let's start with the elephant in the room - or should I say, the LEGO brick in the game? The critics are having a field day trashing this title. COGconnected gave it a paltry 20%, stating it feels like a \"frustrating cash grab.\" Ouch! Eurogamer Italy wasn't much kinder, saying it looks like a rehashed LEGO Worlds without the movie's humor and pace. Metro GameCentral took it to task, calling it a \"cheap and nasty\" film tie-in that reaches new lows for LEGO games.<br><br>But fear not, young players! This review isn't all doom and gloom. 3DJuegos gave it some love, praising the interesting sandbox gameplay mechanics as a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale franchise. And Meristation had some nice things to say about its accessibility - even if they did call it one of the easiest games in the series.<br><br>Now, let's get down to business (or should I say, LEGO bricks?). The gameplay is where this game really falls short. It's a reskin of LEGO Worlds, with all the excitement and thrill of...well, watching paint dry. There's no real challenge, no engaging storyline, and no satisfying sense of accomplishment when you build something awesome (which, let's be real, is what LEGO games are all about).<br><br>But hey, if you're looking for a game that's perfect for tiny tots who love LEGO, this might just do the trick. It's not like they'll be asking for more or complaining about the lack of challenge...oh wait, they probably will.<br><br>All joking aside, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is a disappointing entry in an otherwise beloved franchise. If you're looking for a LEGO game that's actually fun, I'd recommend checking out DC Super-Villains or the re-release of Harry Potter games instead.<br><br>That's it for this review! See you next time when I'll be back to poke fun at more underwhelming gaming experiences.",
