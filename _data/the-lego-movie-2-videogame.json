I've got my favorite snacks, a comfy chair, and a healthy dose of skepticism – let's get this party started!<br><br>First off, it seems like some critics are not impressed (who would have thought?). COGconnected gives it a whopping 20 out of 100, calling it a \"frustrating cash grab\" that's an insult to the very spirit of LEGO. Eurogamer Italy echoes similar sentiments, saying the game looks like a reskin of LEGO Worlds without the charm and humor of the movie.<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, we've got 3DJuegos, who actually enjoys the sandbox gameplay mechanics, comparing them to LEGO Worlds (now that's some nostalgia right there). Meristation gives it a decent score, saying it's an easy game for kids, but a bit of a letdown for adults.<br><br>Now, I'm no expert (okay, maybe a little), but I've got my own opinions and experiences to share. As someone who loves LEGO (who doesn't?!), I went in with moderate expectations – after all, this is a movie tie-in we're talking about. And you know what? It's not the worst thing ever!<br><br>The gameplay is a mixed bag. On one hand, exploring the various levels and collecting LEGO bricks is always fun. On the other hand, some areas feel like they were just phoned in – static environments, anyone? The co-op mode can be a bit wonky at times, too.<br><br>But here's the thing: The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame isn't trying to reinvent the wheel or impress critics with its depth and complexity. It's a kids' game, through and through! And if you're looking for a fun, lighthearted experience that won't break the bank (or your sanity), this might just be the ticket.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, I'm not going to give it a score or anything fancy like that. Instead, I'll just say that The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame is a solid, if unremarkable, addition to the LEGO franchise. If you're a fan of the movies or just looking for some family-friendly fun, this might be worth your time.<br><br>That's it for now, folks! Hippo Penny out – see you in the next review!",
