It's time to dive into the not-so-awesomely received LEGO Movie 2 Videogame!<br><br>As a seasoned grok (see what I did there?) game reviewer, I'm here to give you the lowdown on this film tie-in. And let me tell you, it's been a real treat... said no one ever.<br><br>I've scoured the interwebs for some of the most \"illuminating\" reviews out there (wink), and boy, do they have some harsh words to say about this game! COGconnected thinks it's just a cash grab, Eurogamer Italy says it's got no appeal, and Metro GameCentral... well, let's just say they're not fans of the \"nastiness\" that is LEGO Movie 2 Videogame.<br><br>But don't worry, I'm here to balance things out! After all, every cloud has a silver lining (or in this case, a poorly executed co-op mechanic). 3DJuegos seems to think there's some interesting sandbox gameplay hiding beneath the surface. And Meristation? They're just happy it's easy enough for kids to enjoy!<br><br>So, what does it mean when everything is not awesome? Is LEGO Movie 2 Videogame a one-trick pony that promises the world but delivers mediocrity? Should you bother investing your hard-earned cash in this game?<br><br>Well, kiddos and seasoned gamers alike, let me put it this way: if you're looking for a LEGO experience that's anything less than subpar (ahem), I'd recommend taking a gander at some of the other franchise games. The DC Super-Villains or Harry Potter re-releases might be more up your alley.<br><br>But hey, who knows? You might just find yourself loving this game despite its many flaws! After all, it's all about having fun... and not getting too salty about a mediocre experience (that's me talking, of course!).<br><br>Stay groovy, folks!",
