But before we dive in, let me just say that I'm not as cool as the Video Chums folks, who seem to think this game is \"a ton of fun\" (ahem). Nor am I as laid-back as the guys at Digital Chumps, who still had a blast despite some minor issues. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get to the review!<br><br>In The Lego Movie 2 Videogame, you're dropped into a world of colorful chaos, tasked with collecting bricks, solving puzzles, and saving the day (or, you know, just having fun). It's a classic Lego formula, but does it hold up? Well, some critics would have you believe that this game is as stale as last week's bread (see: Push Square), while others think it's a delightful little romp perfect for families and young players (hello, Video Chums!).<br><br>As someone who's not too keen on replaying the same old Lego gameplay, I was pleasantly surprised to find that TLM2V offers some new twists. The open-world environments are a hoot, allowing you to explore and build to your heart's content. And let's not forget the gadgets – oh boy, do they make this game a blast! (Sorry, had to). But is it enough to make up for the occasional repetition and lack of originality? Hmm...<br><br>I think the most telling review comes from Gameblog.fr: \"The LEGO Movie 2 tries to mix things up a bit... but is dragged down by its repetitive gameplay loop and technical issues.\" Ouch. Meanwhile, COGconnected's scathing critique might be a bit harsh, but they're not wrong – this game does feel like a cash grab at times.<br><br>So what's the takeaway? If you're a young fan of the Lego franchise or just looking for some lighthearted family fun, The Lego Movie 2 Videogame is worth checking out. But if you're a seasoned gamer seeking something new and exciting... well, you might want to look elsewhere.<br><br>And that's my two cents on this brick-tastic (okay, I'll stop) adventure! What do you think, readers? Have any Lego-loving kids who would enjoy this game? Let me know in the comments!",
