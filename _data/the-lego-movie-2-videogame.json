Get ready for a groovy review of the LEGO Movie 2 Videogame!<br><br>As I dived into this brick-tastic game, I couldn't help but think: what's the deal with all these negative reviews? Are they just being a bunch of buzzkills? Let me tell you, I'm here to bring some positivity to the party! After all, who doesn't love building and exploring in a LEGO-filled world?<br><br>First off, let's take a look at COGconnected's scathing review. Oh, burn! They're calling it a \"frustrating cash grab.\" Zing! Yeah, I can see why they'd say that. The gameplay does feel a bit wonky at times, and some of the levels can be a real slog. But hey, what about the kids? Don't they deserve a fun LEGO experience?<br><br>Then there's Eurogamer Italy, who claims it looks like a LEGO World reskin without the movie's humor and pace. Hmm, that's not entirely unfair. The game does feel a bit like a lazy rehash of previous LEGO titles. But maybe that's because it's trying to be too faithful to the movie? I mean, who wouldn't want to play as Emmet and Wyldstyle?<br><br>Metro GameCentral takes it to the next level (pun intended) by calling it \"a cheap and nasty film tie-in.\" Ouch! That hurts, doesn't it? But honestly, what did you expect from a movie game? It's not like they're going to recreate the entire LEGO universe or something.<br><br>On the other hand, 3DJuegos is all about that sandbox gameplay, baby! They're saying it refreshes the over-used LEGO formula. I'm right there with them! The ability to build and explore is where this game shines (see what I did there?). It's like having your own little LEGO world at your fingertips.<br><br>Cubed3, on the other hand, is not so stoked. They're saying it's a \"heavily flawed shell of what the franchise had become.\" Harsh, but fair? Maybe this game is trying to shake things up and be more experimental? Who knows, maybe that's exactly what it needs.<br><br>Meristation gives it some props, saying it's one of the easiest games in the franchise. Yeah, that's true! This game isn't about being super challenging; it's more about having fun with your little LEGO friends. And hey, for kids, that's a recipe for success!<br><br>Finally, TheSixthAxis is like the grumpy old man of the bunch, complaining about static environments and boring construction. Aw, come on! Don't be so serious! This game may not be perfect, but it's still a great way to spend an afternoon with your favorite LEGO characters.<br><br>In conclusion, while this game might not be perfect, it's still a fun little romp for kids (and kids at heart). So don't believe the haters â€“ everything is indeed awesome!<br><br>Hippo out!",
