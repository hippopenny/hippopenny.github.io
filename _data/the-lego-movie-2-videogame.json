COGconnected calls it a \"frustrating cash grab\" and says it's not deserving of LEGO fans. Eurogamer Italy agrees, saying it looks like a reskin of LEGO Worlds without the movie's charm. Metro GameCentral takes it a step further, calling it a \"cheap and nasty film tie-in\" that's reached a new low for LEGO games.<br><br>Now, I'm not one to bash on other reviewers (okay, maybe just a little bit). But seriously, these negative reviews have me thinking: What went wrong? Was it the game's rushed development? The lack of humor? The poor co-op mode?<br><br>As someone who loves a good LEGO game, I was excited to dive in and see what all the fuss was about. And you know what? I had fun! Like, actually-enjoyed-my-time-playing-the-game fun. Don't get me wrong; it's not perfect. The sandbox gameplay is a highlight, reminiscent of LEGO Worlds' creative freedom. But hey, who doesn't love building and exploring?<br><br>I also appreciate the nods to the movie – the voice acting, the levels, the humor (yes, there's some genuine LOLs in here). It may not be as polished as other LEGO games, but it's a step in the right direction.<br><br>So, what does this mean for you young players out there? Well, if you're looking for a fun, family-friendly game that lets you build and explore, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame might just be the ticket. Just don't expect it to be the next Batman or Harry Potter – those are some different beasts entirely.<br><br>In conclusion, I'll leave you with Meristation's words: \"Very recommended for children... But for the rest, 'everything is (not) awesome'.\" Yeah, that about sums it up!",
