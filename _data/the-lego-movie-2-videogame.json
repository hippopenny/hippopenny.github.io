Ouch! They're saying it feels like a cash-grab with little time given to the devs. That's tough love right there. Meanwhile, Eurogamer Italy is like, \"Meh, it's not even that good.\" (50/100) They think it looks like a reskinned LEGO Worlds game without the movie's humor and pace. *sigh* DC Super-Villains or Harry Potter games, anyone?<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: What about the other reviews? Well, Metro GameCentral is being super harsh, saying it's the \"new low\" for Lego games (30/100). Whoa! They must really hate this game. On the flip side, 3DJuegos thinks it's got some interesting sandbox gameplay mechanics that refresh the LEGO formula (75/100). That's a major 180 from Metro GameCentral!<br><br>Cubed3 is all like, \"Everything is meh.\" (40/100) They're saying it feels like they changed things just to be different, but in a bad way. The game's not even okay! And then we've got Meristation giving it a 68/100, saying it's one of the easiest games in the franchise, but still has some graphical issues. *shrugs* Kids might love it, but for adults... not so much.<br><br>Last but not least, we've got TheSixthAxis going full-on Grinch-mode (40/100), calling it an uninspired and dull reskin of LEGO Worlds that tosses the good parts in the bin. That's some strong language! *chuckles* They think even President Business would have done better than this.<br><br>So there you have it, folks! The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame: a mixed bag of opinions. What do I think? Well, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - if you're looking for a fun LEGO game, look elsewhere... or at least give this one a pass. But hey, if you're a kid, you might just find it \"everything is awesome\"-ific! *winks*",
