Or, at least, that's what I'm hoping for with The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame.<br><br>Now, I know some critics out there might say this game is a bit of a letdown (see: COGconnected, scoring it a measly 20). And, honestly, I can see why. The game does feel like a cash grab at times, and the co-op mode? More like \"co- op failure\" am I right?<br><br>But, hey! Not everyone agrees that this game is a total waste of bricks (pun intended). 3DJuegos thinks it's got some fresh sandbox gameplay that shakes things up for the franchise. And, you know what? I'm kinda with them on this one.<br><br>The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame might not be the most groundbreaking game out there, but it's still a whole lot of fun! The worlds are colorful and full of life, just like the movies. And, who doesn't love building and exploring?<br><br>Of course, some critics (like Metro GameCentral) think this game is a total trainwreck. But, hey! Even they can't deny that it's got some charm.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, let me put it this way: if you're looking for a LEGO game to get your kiddo into, this one might not be the worst choice. Just don't expect it to be the most epic adventure ever.<br><br>And hey, at least the graphics aren't totally busted... most of the time (Meristation gives it a 68).<br><br>All right, that's my two cents on The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame. What do you think? Are you ready to join Emmet and Wyldstyle on their next adventure?<br><br>Stay groovy, folks!",
