But don't worry, I'm here to bring some positivity and humor to this review!<br><br>Let's get the lowdown from our fellow critics first. COGconnected gave it a dismal 20 out of 100, saying it felt like a \"frustrating cash grab.\" Ouch! Eurogamer Italy was even harsher, scoring it 50 out of 100 and calling it a \"LEGO World reskin\" without the humor or pace of the movie. Metro GameCentral took aim at its co-op, calling it \"broken,\" and deemed it a \"new low\" for LEGO games.<br><br>But wait! There's a glimmer of hope! 3DJuegos gave it a decent 75 out of 100, praising its sandbox gameplay mechanics. Cubed3 was a bit more mixed, scoring it 40 out of 100 and saying it took a \"huge step backward.\" Meristation echoed this sentiment, giving it 68 out of 100 and calling it an \"easy\" game for children.<br><br>TheSixthAxis, however, just threw in the towel, scoring it 40 out of 100 and calling it a \"throwback to the bad old days of movie tie-ins.\"<br><br>So, what's my take on this game? Well, I'm here to tell you that even with its flaws, The LEGO Movie 2: The Videogame has some fun moments. The LEGO games are known for their family-friendly humor and light-hearted gameplay, and this one delivers on that front.<br><br>One of the highlights is the variety of playable characters, each with their unique abilities and strengths. My favorite was Benny the Spaceman â€“ he's got a sweet spaceship and some awesome laser powers! <br><br>The game also has some clever level design, with puzzles that are both fun and challenging. Okay, so maybe they're not as challenging as the puzzles in LEGO World, but still!<br><br>However, where this game truly falls short is in its repetition. The levels can get a bit samey, and the co-op mode is indeed broken (sorry, Eurogamer Italy, you were right on that one!).<br><br>All in all, while The LEGO Movie 2: The Videogame might not be the best LEGO game out there, it's still an enjoyable romp for kids and adults alike. If you're a fan of the movie or the franchise, you'll likely find some fun moments to cherish.<br><br>So, what's my final verdict? Well, I'm not going to give this game a score like those other critics did (wink). Instead, I'll just say that if you're looking for a lighthearted, family-friendly gaming experience with a dash of LEGO magic, The LEGO Movie 2: The Videogame might be worth a look. Just don't expect too much in the way of innovation or depth!<br><br>Thanks for joining me on this wild ride, folks! Until next time, stay awesome and keep on gaming!",
