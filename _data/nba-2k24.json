    "comment": "NBA 2K24 offers solid on-court action with improved gameplay mechanics, but is overshadowed by an excessive focus on microtransactions that hinders the overall experience. The game continues to showcase its strengths in gameplay and graphics, but the heavy reliance on virtual currency leaves a sour taste for many players. While the improvements in player control and AI are commendable, the game's potential is hampered by the overshadowing presence of microtransactions, limiting the accessibility and enjoyment for the average player. It's a shame that such a promising title gets bogged down by financial barriers, overshadowing its gameplay brilliance.",
