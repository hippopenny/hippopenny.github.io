Now, I know what you're thinking - another XCOM-like game? Yawn. But trust me, folks, Capes brings something new to the table.<br><br>First off, let's talk about those caped crusaders. You get to play as a team of superheroes with powers ranging from telekinesis to invisibility. The combat system is turn-based, which means you'll be thinking strategically about how to use each character's abilities to take down those pesky villains. And when I say strategic, I mean it - this game will keep you on your toes.<br><br>Now, some critics might say that the story is a bit of a snooze-fest (cough, IGN, cough). But honestly, who cares? The real fun is in the gameplay, and Capes delivers. You'll be hooked from the get-go, whether you're sneaking around stealthily or charging in guns blazing.<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect, and some folks might find the stealth missions a tad underwhelming (Gaming Age, I'm looking at you). But overall, Capes is a real showstopper. The visuals are vibrant, the characters are well-written, and the combat system is deep enough to keep even the most hardcore gamers engaged.<br><br>Now, before I wrap things up, let me just say that some critics seem to have their heads stuck in a few places (looking at you, Vandal). Quotations forthcoming? More like quotations forgotten! Just saying.<br><br>All joking aside, Capes is an absolute blast. It's the perfect game for anyone who loves XCOM but wants more variety and excitement in their superhero gameplay. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.<br><br>And that's it from this hippo penny reviewer! See you next time, gamers!",
