It's your favorite (okay, only) seasonal grok video game reviewer here, ready to dive into the world of Capes and see if it's as super as its name suggests!<br><br>First off, let me just say that I love how critics are all about the numbers game. I mean, who doesn't love a good score? It's like they're trying to make us feel better by giving us a quantifiable reason to care (80 here, 70 there). But honestly, what really matters is if the gameplay holds up. And in Capes' case, it totally does!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about XCOM? Is this just more of the same?\" Well, let me tell you, fellow gamers – this is NOT your grandma's tactical combat game! (Sorry, Grandma, if that offends). While Capes takes some inspiration from XCOM, it adds its own special sauce with the ability to combine powers and ultimate abilities. It's like a superhero team-up in a turn-based battle!<br><br>The critics seem to agree, with many praising the game's clever combat mechanics and entertaining storyline. And honestly, who wouldn't want to play as a caped crusader with the power of flight? I mean, come on – it's like having a superpower (but not, you know, too super).<br><br>Of course, no review would be complete without some snarky commentary about other critics. So, IGN, worth playing, Vandal, and all the rest: yes, Capes is a great game that will keep you engaged for hours on end. And if it's not perfect? Well, as PC Gamer so astutely put it, \"An awkward story doesn't hold [Capes] back from being one of the best turn-based strategy games of recent years.\" Amen to that!<br><br>In conclusion (drumroll please)... Capes is a game that will leave you feeling like you've got superpowers! With its unique combat mechanics, engaging storyline, and colorful visuals, it's a must-play for anyone looking for some superhero-flavored fun. So go ahead, grab your cape (or not), and get ready to save the world!<br><br>P.S. And don't worry, GameStar – we won't hold your \"Quotation forthcoming\" against you.",
