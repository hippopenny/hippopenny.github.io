From IGN to PC Gamer, critics are raving about its clever gameplay and vibrant visuals. But is it worth donning the cape yourself?<br><br>As I jumped into the fray, I was struck by how Capes' character designs looked like they were ripped straight from a comic book (in a good way!). The art style is bold and colorful, making each hero feel like a unique, superpowered friend. And speaking of heroes, the ultimate abilities are a real showstopper – watching your characters combine powers to take down enemies is pure fun!<br><br>But what about the gameplay? Well, let me tell you, it's a wild ride! Chasing optional objectives and experimenting with different strategies keeps things fresh and exciting. The stealth missions, while not as polished, offer a nice change of pace and some clever challenges. And when you're done with the main campaign, there are plenty more hours of fun to be had in the game's extensive multiplayer mode.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the critics who didn't love it?\" Ah, yes! I'm looking at you, Gaming Age – sorry, guys, but Capes just doesn't quite live up to its promise. And GameStar, don't worry, your quotation-forthcoming review is still waiting for me... <br><br>All joking aside, Capes is an absolute blast, and if you're a fan of XCOM or superhero games in general, you owe it to yourself to try this one out. So go ahead, grab that cape, and get ready to save the world!<br><br>(Just don't expect me to join you – I'll be over here, still trying to figure out how to use my superpowers for good... or, you know, just for fun.)",
