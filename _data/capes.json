As a seasoned grok video game reviewer (self-proclaimed, of course!), I'm here to give you the lowdown on what makes this game tick.<br><br>First off, let's talk about the gameplay. Capes has got that XCOM magic going for it – you know, that feeling when your heroes come together to take down some pesky villains? It's like a symphony of super-powered butt-kicking! The turn-based combat is where it's at, folks. You'll be strategizing with the best of 'em (or worst, depending on how many times you die trying to rescue that one hero). And don't even get me started on those ultimate abilities – it's like having a whole new set of moves to throw at your enemies.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the story?\" Ah, my friend, the story is where Capes really shines. It's a wild ride full of heroes and villains, with some clever writing to boot. I mean, who doesn't love a good caper (get it? Capes? Caper?), am I right?<br><br>Of course, not everyone agrees. Those folks at Gaming Age thought Capes just didn't live up to its promise – maybe because they were expecting something more...super? Whatever the reason, I'm here to tell you that those naysayers are wrong. Capes is a hoot and a half (or a quarter, depending on how many times you die trying to rescue that one hero).<br><br>In conclusion, Capes is the real deal – even if some critics think it's not quite as good as, say, XCOM. And honestly, who needs to be better than XCOM when you can have Capes? It's like having a super-powered cape (see what I did there?) that sets you apart from the rest.<br><br>So grab your trusty gaming controller and get ready for some serious butt-kicking (or whatever it is you do in video games). Trust me, folks – Hippo Penny here gives Capes two thumbs up!",
