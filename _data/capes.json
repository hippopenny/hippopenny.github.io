With a plethora of glowing reviews from critics like IGN (80), Hardcore Gamer (80), and PC Gamer (80), I was eager to see if the hype would translate to an unforgettable gaming experience.<br><br>As I strapped on my cape (okay, not literally) and dived into the world of turn-based tactical combat, I quickly discovered that Capes is a game that will keep you on your toes. The clever blend of superhero powers and strategic teamplay had me feeling like a true hero-in-training. Who doesn't love unleashing a well-coordinated combo attack to take down those pesky villains?<br><br>The critics are spot-on when praising the game's campaign, which is both substantial and entertainingly written. I won't lie; I got hooked on chasing those optional objectives, experimenting with different character combos, and counter-strategizing against the various enemy types. It's like they say: \"With great power comes great responsibility\"... to play a whole lot of Capes!<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about those stealth missions? Don't they feel a bit... wonky?\" Ah, yes! Those stealthy segments do take a little getting used to, but let's just say they're like the Kryptonite of the game – not deal-breakers, but definitely an area for improvement.<br><br>While I wouldn't call myself a superhero expert (I mean, have you seen my attempt at flying? More like \"flying\" into a lamp post...), I did enjoy the narrative's themes of control and resistance in a dystopian future. It adds a layer of depth to the game that makes it more than just mindless action.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Capes is an absolute blast – perfect for fans of turn-based strategy games like XCOM! Sure, there might be some minor audio-visual sync issues or balance quirks in combat, but these are mere nitpicks compared to the hours of engaging gameplay on offer. If you're looking for a game that will challenge you and keep you coming back for more, look no further!<br><br>(And don't worry, I won't make any more terrible superhero puns... until next time, that is!)",
