But before I do, let me just say that as a seasonal grok reviewer (that's me!), I've been known to be a bit of a goofball. So, if you're expecting a staid, by-the-book review, you've come to the wrong place!<br><br>Now, onto Capes! IGN says it's \"clever and challenging,\" and I gotta agree - this game is a real brain-twister. You play as an action figure-like character (think miniature Marvel heroes) who must use their unique abilities to take down baddies. It's like XCOM, but with capes (of course)! The combat system is intricate, and the visuals are vibrant - it's a feast for the eyes!<br><br>But what really sets Capes apart is its focus on teamwork and strategy. You'll need to coordinate with your teammates (AI-controlled or human-controlled) to execute complex attacks and take down tough foes. And did I mention that there are optional objectives to chase? It adds a whole new level of replayability and challenge to the mix!<br><br>Now, about those critics... IGN seems to love it, while Vandal is, well, still writing their review (no quotes forthcoming!). PC Gamer gives it a solid 80, saying the awkward story doesn't hold Capes back. The Games Machine agrees, calling it \"fun, complex and colourful\" - but also \"very difficult.\" CGMagazine thinks it's just \"good enough,\" lacking that certain je ne sais quoi.<br><br>As for me? I'm having a blast (pun intended) with Capes! It's a game that'll keep you on your toes, even when the going gets tough. And hey, who doesn't love a good caped crusader?<br><br>That's it for this review - Hippo Penny out!",
