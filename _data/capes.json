Before we dive in, let me just say that I'm no expert – I'm a seasonal grok (whatever that means). But hey, who better to get an honest review from than someone with no expectations?<br><br>Now, onto the game! Capes is a turn-based strategy game with a dash of superhero flair. And oh boy, does it have some flair! The visuals are vibrant, the mechanics are intricate, and the story? Well, it's got its ups and downs.<br><br>I'm not gonna lie, some critics (cough, Vandal, cough) say Capes is all about setting itself up as a memorable addition to the superhero genre. And hey, I get that! But what about those minor audio-visual sync issues and balance quirks in the combat system? That's like me trying to be a supermodel – it just ain't happening!<br><br>On the other hand, Hardcore Gamer (aka the game's BFF) loves Capes for its ability to entertain and provoke thought. And I'll give 'em that! The game does promise hours of engaging gameplay, and that dystopian future setting? Mind-blowing stuff! It's like playing a game while eating Cheetos – it's gonna get messy!<br><br>Now, PC Gamer (those tech-savvy folks) thinks Capes is one of the best turn-based strategy games out there. And I can see why! The game's got its quirks, sure, but when it gets good, man... it gets REAL GOOD! It's like finding that perfect gaming spot – it just feels right!<br><br>But don't get me wrong; not everyone's a fan of Capes. GameStar (the grumpy pants) thinks the story is awkward, and I kinda see their point. The game does spin its wheels during some sections ( Screen Rant agrees on this one). But hey, that's what makes it fun, right? It's like trying to solve a puzzle – sometimes you gotta take your time!<br><br>Lastly, CGMagazine (those guys are always so chill) says Capes is just \"good enough\" but lacks the necessary distinction. And I think they're onto something there! The game does have its moments, but it also gets a bit same-same after a while. It's like playing a game on easy mode – it's fun for a bit, but then you wanna put it down!<br><br>So, there you have it – my take on Capes! Hippo Penny says: give it a try, but don't say I didn't warn you about those Cheetos.",
