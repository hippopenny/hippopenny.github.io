And by everyone, I mean those fancy-pants critics who think they're smarter than me just because they've got a bigger vocabulary.<br><br>But seriously, folks, I'm excited to dive into this game and see what all the fuss is about. So, let's get to it!<br><br>First off, Capes has got some serious style going on. The characters are like action figures come to life - and not in a creepy way, either! Each one has its own unique powers and abilities, which you can combine in all sorts of creative ways. It's like having your very own superpowered team (minus the whole \"saving the world from certain doom\" thing).<br><br>The gameplay itself is where Capes really shines. It's XCOM meets superheroes, and trust me, it's a match made in heaven! You've got your standard turn-based strategy fare - move, attack, repeat - but with the added bonus of having to manage your characters' powers, abilities, and (sometimes) sanity. It's like trying to solve a puzzle while juggling chainsaws (which, fun fact, is actually my day job).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the story?\" Well, let me tell you, it's not exactly Shakespearean. But hey, who needs high literature when you've got explosions, supervillains, and butt-kicking action? It's like a superhero soap opera - drama-filled, yet oddly engaging.<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect (except maybe my mom, but that's a whole different story). There are some minor quirks here and there - the combat system can get a bit wonky at times, and some of the visuals might be a tad off. But hey, these are just minor complaints when you're having this much fun!<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, I think Capes is a real blast (pun intended). If you're looking for a game that's both challenging and rewarding, with plenty of opportunities to get creative with your characters' powers - then look no further! It's the perfect game for anyone who loves superheroes, strategy, or just having a good time.<br><br>And don't even get me started on those fancy critics. I mean, seriously, IGN and PC Gamer? You're telling me that these games are only 80% good? What, did they not have fun like I did?! Vandal, you get points for being mysterious - but come on, a score of 70 is a little harsh, don't you think?<br><br>Anyway, there you have it! My two cents on Capes. If you're still reading this far down the page, then I guess I've done my job well. So go ahead, grab your cape (or not - we won't judge), and get ready to join the fun!<br><br>This review is brought to you by yours truly - the grokiest, most enthusiastic reviewer around!",
