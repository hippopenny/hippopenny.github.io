But before I dive into my thoughts, I've gotta give a shoutout to all those other critics out there who have already given their two cents.<br><br>Take Hardcore Gamer, for instance. They're like the ultimate Capes cheerleader - 80 points and praise galore! Who wouldn't want to play a game that's \"memorable\" and has \"narrative that both entertains and provokes thought\"? I mean, sign me up!<br><br>But then there's PC Gamer, who seems to be the voice of reason. They're like the cool older sibling who says, \"Hey, the story might be awkward, but the gameplay is still solid.\" 80 points again! These guys must really love Capes.<br><br>Now, let's talk about GameStar. Ooh, they're a bit more critical - 67 points and that ominous \"Quotation forthcoming\" warning. I guess you could say they're the equivalent of your grumpy old uncle who just wants to tell it like it is.<br><br>The Games Machine, on the other hand, is all about the challenge. They're like the gamers' version of a fitness guru - \"Capes is perfect for those looking for a level of challenge similar to that of any XCOM.\" 83 points? You bet!<br><br>CGMagazine and Screen Rant are more or less in agreement, giving Capes a solid 70 points each. It's like they're saying, \"Hey, it's not the best game out there, but it's still pretty good.\"<br><br>And then there's PCGamesN, who's all about that strategic gameplay. They give Capes 60 points and say it's \"mostly\" worth playing, despite its clich√©s and limitations. Yeah, they're like the gamers' version of a no-nonsense accountant - \"It's not perfect, but it gets the job done.\"<br><br>Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking - Hippo Penny, stop yapping about other critics! Let's get to your review already!<br><br>Here's my take: Capes is an absolute blast to play. The turn-based strategy gameplay is top-notch, with a great mix of action and puzzle-solving. The visuals are vibrant and colorful, making for a visually stunning experience.<br><br>Now, I know some folks might be turned off by the narrative - it's not the most original story out there. But hey, who doesn't love saving the world from an alien invasion every now and then?<br><br>Overall, Capes is an excellent addition to the superhero genre. It's got heart, humor, and a whole lot of fun. And even if it's not perfect (who is?), I think you'll find it hard to put down.<br><br>That's it for my review! See you in the next one!",
