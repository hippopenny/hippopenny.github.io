I'm diving into the world of Capes, where superheroes and villains clash in a turn-based tactical combat extravaganza. The question on everyone's mind: is it cape-tastic or just plain bland?<br><br>First off, hats off to IGN for their glowing review (Score: 80). They're totally right; watching those action figure-like characters combine their powers and supercharge their ultimate abilities does sell teamwork well. And those optional objectives in each mission? Yeah, they give you a lot to think about when it comes to countering all sorts of enemy types.<br><br>But what about the rest of the critics? Vandal (Score: 70) seems a bit meh about the whole thing, saying their review will come... eventually. Hardcore Gamer (Score: 80) agrees with IGN, praising the game's visuals, mechanics, and narrative. PC Gamer (Score: 80) echoes that sentiment, saying it's one of the best turn-based strategy games out there – even if the story is a bit awkward.<br><br>GameStar (Score: 67) seems to be on the fence, while The Games Machine (Score: 83) loves the challenge and complexity. And poor CGMagazine (Score: 70), they just can't seem to find that extra oomph to take Capes to new heights.<br><br>Now, onto my own review! After diving into this game, I found myself having a blast – literally! The combat is clever, challenging, and utterly delightful. When your heroes are combining powers and supercharging their ultimate abilities, it's like watching a choreographed dance routine... with laser beams.<br><br>But what about the story? Well, let's just say it's not the most memorable thing since sliced bread. It's there, it's presentable, but I wouldn't exactly call it a masterpiece of storytelling.<br><br>Ultimately, Capes is a great game for those looking for a challenge similar to XCOM. It's fun, complex, and colorful – with moments that'll make you feel all the emotions and hours of fun.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, let's just say I'm not going to make a big splashy statement about it... because I'm trying to be humble. But trust me, this game is worth your time – especially if you enjoy turn-based strategy games with a side of superhero flair!<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go cape-italize my day (see what I did there?).",
