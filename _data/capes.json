But before we begin, let me just say that I'm feeling pretty good about myself today. Why, you ask? Well, it's not because I'm a master reviewer with decades of experience (although, let's be real, that would be nice). No, no! It's because I managed to get my cat to sit still for two whole minutes while I was writing this review. That's right, folks, I'm basically a cat whisperer now!<br><br>Okay, enough about me and my feline friends. Let's talk about Capes! IGN seems to think that the game is \"clever and challenging,\" with a campaign that's full of variety and depth. They're not wrong – as you play through the game, you'll find yourself switching between different heroes, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. And let me tell you, it's a real blast using these heroes to take down the villains (or, at least, trying to).<br><br>But what really sets Capes apart is its focus on teamwork. You see, in this game, you're not just fighting alone – you're working together with your fellow superheroes to take down enemy forces. It's a real team effort, folks! And it's something that sets Capes apart from other turn-based strategy games.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Hippo Penny, what about the critics?\" Well, let me tell you, there are plenty of them out there who love Capes just as much as I do. Worth Playing seems to think that it's a great example of how the XCOM formula can still be successful even when done differently. They're not wrong – Capes is definitely a unique take on the whole \"turn-based strategy\" genre.<br><br>But what about the not-so-positive reviews? Well, let me just say that I'm not too worried about them. After all, as any good reviewer knows, everyone has their own opinions (and biases). Vandal seems to think that Capes is just okay – and hey, who am I to argue with that? Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. And GameStar... well, let's just say that they're a bit more negative than the rest. But hey, even the most skeptical reviewer can find something to like in Capes!<br><br>So there you have it, folks – my review of Capes. It's a game that's all about teamwork, strategy, and good old-fashioned superhero fun. And if you're looking for a new game to add to your collection, then Capes is definitely worth checking out. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
