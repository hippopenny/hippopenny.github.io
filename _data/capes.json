    "comment": "Hippo Penny, folks! It's your favorite seasonal grok video game reviewer here to give you the lowdown on Capes. I'll get right to it - this game is a real superhero (get it? superhero? okay, moving on...).<br><br>The combat in Capes is like a well-executed (pun intended) combo of XCOM and... more XCOM! Just kidding, folks. In all seriousness, the game does an excellent job of mixing up the action with clever enemy movements, environmental obstacles, and your heroes' diverse abilities. I mean, what's not to love about watching your action figure-like characters combine their powers like a well-choreographed dance routine (minus the awkwardness of actually doing it in real life... trust me, I've tried)?<br><br>The story is entertainingly written, with engaging characters and villains that'll keep you invested throughout the substantial campaign. And let's not forget the stealth missions - they're mostly optional, but they add an extra layer of strategy to proceedings. It's like trying to sneak into a room without tripping on your own feet (which, honestly, is just about my level of ninja skill...).<br><br>Now, I know some critics (cough, IGN, cough) might say Capes doesn't quite reach its full potential in terms of storytelling or character development. But hey, who needs deep characters when you've got caped crusaders and cape-tastic action sequences, right?<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect, and there are minor audio-visual sync issues and balance quirks in the combat system (shout-out to Hardcore Gamer for pointing those out). However, these are relatively minor complaints compared to the overall fun you'll have playing Capes.<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a superhero-filled romp with strategic combat and engaging storytelling, Capes is the game for you. Just don't expect me to be the one saving the day anytime soon - I'll stick to my couch, thank you very much!<br><br>Stay groovy, folks!",
