Ah yes, Capes, a game about superheroes and tactical turn-based combat. Sounds like a match made in heaven, right?<br><br>Now, I'm not one to brag (okay, fine, I am), but I think my reviews are pretty on point. *wink* But let's see what the other critics have to say.<br><br>IGN gives it an 80, saying that Capes is \"clever and challenging\" with a \"substantial campaign.\" That sounds like a lot of fun! Worth Playing agrees, giving it another 80 for being just plain fun. I mean, who doesn't love a good XCOM-style game? Even Vandal, the critic who's always looking for something new, gives it a respectable 70.<br><br>Now, Hardcore Gamer and PC Gamer both give Capes an 80 as well, praising its \"vibrant visuals,\" \"intricate gameplay mechanics,\" and \"narrative that entertains and provokes thought.\" I mean, what more could you ask for? Even The Games Machine chimes in with a glowing review, saying it's the perfect game for those looking for a challenge similar to XCOM.<br><br>GameStar, on the other hand, seems to be the only holdout, giving Capes a mere 67. Quotation forthcoming, indeed! *rolls eyes* Oh well, I guess you can't please everyone.<br><br>So, what's the takeaway from all this? Well, if you like superheroes and turn-based strategy games, Capes is definitely worth checking out. Even if you're not a fan of one or both of those genres, it seems like there's something for everyone here. And hey, even if GameStar doesn't love it (okay, fine, they don't say much about it at all), that doesn't mean the rest of us can't have some fun with it!",
