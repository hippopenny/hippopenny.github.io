I'm back with another groovy review of Capes, the latest turn-based strategy game that has got everyone talking. As a seasonal critic, I'm always on the lookout for games that bring something new and exciting to the table, and boy, does Capes deliver!<br><br>But before we dive into the nitty-gritty of this superhero-flavored tactical combat game, let me just say that I'm loving life as a groovy game reviewer. Who wouldn't want to play all these awesome games and share their thoughts with the world? It's like being a kid in a candy store (or a hippie at Woodstock - same difference)!<br><br>Now, about those reviews... Let's see what some of the big critics have to say:<br><br>IGN: \"Capes' clever and challenging take on superhero-flavored turn-based tactical combat gives you all of the information you need to turn the tables on its villains.\" (80/100)<br><br>Gaming Age: \"It’s got a great idea but it doesn’t come close to living up to its promise, and you’re better off playing any number of other superhero games or XCOM-alikes.\" (60/100)<br><br>Worth Playing: \"Overall, Capes is just fun. If you like XCOM but wanted your heroes to have more power from the get-go, Capes scratches that itch incredibly well.\" (80/100)<br><br>Vandal: *no quotation forthcoming* (70/100)<br><br>Hardcore Gamer: \"With its vibrant visuals, intricate gameplay mechanics and a narrative that both entertains and provokes thought, Capes sets itself up as a memorable addition to the superhero genre.\" (80/100)<br><br>PC Gamer: \"An awkward story doesn’t hold Capes back from being one of the best turn-based strategy games of recent years.\" (80/100)<br><br>GameStar: *no quotation forthcoming* (67/100)<br><br>Hmm, looks like some critics are having a blast with Capes, while others are not so impressed. But don't worry, folks; I'm here to give you my two cents - and trust me, it's gonna be a doozy!<br><br>Capes is all about teamwork, strategy, and superhero fun! You get to control a team of caped crusaders as they take on the bad guys in turn-based combat. And let me tell you, it's a real hoot! The game has a great sense of humor, and the characters are all super charming (sorry, had to!).<br><br>But what really sets Capes apart is its ability to balance action and strategy. You've got your fast-paced combat sequences, followed by thoughtful strategic decisions. It's like playing a superhero-themed game of chess - minus the boredom!<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect, and Capes has some minor issues. The story can be a bit meh at times (sorry, I had to), and there might be some balance quirks in the combat system. But honestly, who cares? This game is so much fun that you won't even notice!<br><br>So, if you're looking for a new turn-based strategy game that's all about superheroes, teamwork, and kicking butt, then Capes is definitely worth checking out! Trust me, it'll be a blast - and don't worry, I won't make too many more cape-related puns. Okay, fine; one more: It's the cape-ital of superhero games!<br><br>Hippo Penny - Game on!",
