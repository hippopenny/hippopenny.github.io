Or, at least, they're trying to scream above the eerie silence of the Beira D.<br><br>As I navigated through the dimly lit corridors of this Lovecraftian horror game, I couldn't help but think: \"What would the other critics say if they had to walk in my flip-flops?\" Okay, maybe not flip-flops, but you get the idea. I mean, IGN France thought it was a game that grabs you deeply (score: 90), while PlayStation Universe praised its authenticity and engaging story (score: 85). GamesHub and God is a Geek also chimed in with glowing reviews, each scoring an impressive 80.<br><br>But then there's GameSpot, which, while acknowledging the game's unsettling moments, thought it was \"simplified\" (score: 70) and The Sydney Morning Herald, who found it to be \"stunning but gruesome\" despite its linear structure (score: 60). And poor Dot Esports got lost in the depths of the Beira D, struggling to find a riveting story (score: 40).<br><br>Now, I'm not here to rehash all the scores or critic comments. That's what you folks are here for – to form your own opinions and, quite possibly, scream at the screen when you encounter that creepy monster.<br><br>What I am here to do is give you a taste of what Still Wakes The Deep has to offer: an atmosphere so thick with tension it'll make your skin crawl. A story that tugs at your heartstrings, even if it does feel a tad predictable. And a setting that's just begging to be explored – or avoided, depending on how scared you are.<br><br>In short, Still Wakes The Deep is a game that'll keep you up all night, wondering what lurks in the shadows of the Beira D. So, grab some popcorn, dim the lights, and get ready for a thrill ride that's sure to leave you... well, still waking.",
