    "comment": "Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a stealthy slice of strategic brilliance set in 17th-Century Japan. The game's uncommon attentiveness to characters and story, coupled with its punishing yet clever top-down stealth gameplay, make it a refreshing and mentally stimulating quest for any ninja-wannabe. While the near-constant annoyance of the camera might hinder your inner zen ninja, the masterful execution of basic ideas makes it one of the best stealth games in recent memory. With a good presentation and solid controls, it's an excellent choice for strategy and stealth game aficionados. It's like a challenging and satisfying update to a familiar formula, bringing back the atmosphere of classic tactical games with hard and fun gameplay. Whether you find yourself cheering at your well-planned success or groaning at your own poor planning, the relentless difficulty and replayability keep you coming back for more. Just be prepared for a few late nights on the battlefield.",
