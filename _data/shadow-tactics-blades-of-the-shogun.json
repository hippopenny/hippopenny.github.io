    "comment": "Step into the shoes of a sneaky ninja and immerse yourself in the punishing and clever top-down stealth world of Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. This game's uncommon attentiveness to characters and story elevates the entertaining and mentally stimulating quest across 17th-Century Japan. Despite the near-constant annoyance of the camera, developer Mimimi has crafted a masterpiece that brings back the atmosphere of classic tactical action games. With challenging and satisfying gameplay, Shadow Tactics is a pleasant surprise for stealth and strategy fans alike.",
