The new gear system adds an exciting twist to the traditional formula, and the level design feels familiar yet fresh. Despite some minor flaws, like odd difficulty spikes and a somewhat safe approach, this title is a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. So gear up, jump into action, and get ready to experience Mega Man's finest adventure in years!",
