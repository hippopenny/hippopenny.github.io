    "comment": "Shadowrun: Dragonfall Director's Cut is a cyberpunk delight with exceptional tactical combat and an engaging storyline that will keep you hooked long after the finale. The game's writing beautifully supports its immersive world, but the sub-par tactical gameplay may leave some players wishing for more. Overall, it's a must-play for RPG fans unless cyberpunk and dragons aren't your cup of tea.",
