Let's dive into Sumerian Six, a stealth game that has critics frothing at the mouth like... well, hippos in tutus!<br><br>First off, Gamer Escape is absolutely enamored with this game. They give it a 100/100 score and say it's one of the best stealth games they've ever played. Phew! Sounds like Sumerian Six is a winner, right from the get-go. But, oh wait, Gamer Escape also mentions that there are \"small flaws\" in here and there... Hmm, wonder what those might be...<br><br>Gameliner is another fan, giving it a 90/100 score. They say Artificer has done an impressive job with the game's unique characters, story, and level design. It's like they're trying to out-ninja each other! However, Gameliner does mention that the beginning can be \"frustrating\" for some players... Ahahah, I think that's just Hippospeak for finding a better strategy<br><br>Next up is Shacknews! They were actually quite surprised by how much they enjoyed the game. With a score of 80/100, they give Artificer kudos for creating innovative gameplay mechanics and toolsets to \"make do with some of their own less-than-stellar choices.\" Good news: that just means we get more hippos dancing on our radar screen!<br><br>We've got two new fans chomping at the bit, too! Finger Guns gives Sumerian Six a 80/100 score while praising Artificer's work in creating an intricate and smart level design, along with those \"devastating and creative abilities\". That means when they're done playing (if that's even possible), we get more free hippos on our hands out there!<br><br>Wait - who else joins the \"Hippos-tastic Party\"?! Checkpoint Gaming chimes in with their 80/100 score. They found it impressive how Artificer succeeded at replicating those stealth giants from before while showing some amazing \"creative juices\". Time to find new Hippos in tutus!<br><br>Italian, eh? IGN Italia pops up for a spot of tea! What's got 'em hooked is combining Enigma Squad members' strengths in real time - that's not exactly what hippos wear under their tunics when we were all getting started either...<br><br>Last but definitely NOT LEAST WELLPlayed shows us the best stealth game for solving murder mysteries - that means solving some sort of a mysterious, secret hippos-only dance problem out there! Get ready to grab hold tight and be patient while getting your Hippos-tastic score - save scumming not included.<br><br>And... after all this Hippos-and-Tutus partying around Sumerian Six it turns out I am as clueless of how much fun I might have been having while making that commentary for you. So, what did we get from our list today? Sumerian Six might be a game where stealth meets strategy with a dash of uniqueness and style in real time tactics but most importantly - a good chance to play it if you're into solving mystery puzzles that involve Nazis and some pretty cool abilities! Time to join the party or get left out in Hipposville",
