With a cast of lovable heroes (and villains), it's hard not to get caught up in the nostalgic charm of this retro-style romp.<br><br>But let's get real - as reviewers, we're here to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak. And boy, do some critics bring the heat. Take IGN, for instance, who praised the game for its ease and accessibility, but also lamented the lack of online co-op. You know what they say: \"What's good enough for couch buddies isn't always good enough for online squad goals.\" <br><br>Meanwhile, GamingTrend took a more scathing approach, calling Wrath of the Mutants a \"sloppy bout of sewer surfin'\". Ouch, that burns. It seems even the most optimistic reviewers had trouble finding something truly remarkable about this game.<br><br>But hey, not everyone's a hater! Hardcore Gamer gave it some props for playing it safe and being a decent addition to the TMNT collection. And let's be real - if you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or genre, Wrath of the Mutants is bound to bring a smile to your face. Even if it's not exactly breaking new ground.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about TheSixthAxis? They seem to have lost all sense of reason and love for TMNT.\" And honestly, I can't disagree - their review was as harsh as it gets. It seems even the most ardent fans of the genre won't be impressed by this budget release.<br><br>GameSpew took a more measured approach, praising the gameplay while lamenting its lack of innovation. It's like they're saying, \"Hey, Wrath of the Mutants is fine...but I've seen better.\"<br><br>Finally, Impulsegamer gave it a solid 66, but with some major caveats - namely that this game just can't compete with other retro options out there.<br><br>Last but not least, Video Chums came in with a score of 56, calling Wrath of the Mutants \"simple beat-em-up entertainment\" that's fun for a couchful of friends. Not bad, not bad at all!<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, if you're a TMNT fan or just looking for some light-hearted, pick-up-and-play fun, Wrath of the Mutants might be worth your while. Just don't expect anything revolutionary. And hey, who knows - maybe this game will surprise us and grow on us like a good slice of pizza!",
