Been there, done that. But hear me out, because this one's got some Aussie charm (get it? Like, from Australia, mate?) and some genuinely tough choices.<br><br>First off, let me say I'm loving the hate train rolling in from my fellow critics. IGN says it's an ambitious game that can't meet its own expectations - Ouch! Vandal gives it a lukewarm 62, citing poor combat and repetitive missions - Zing! And Eurogamer? Forget about it, mate - they're just mad because the game didn't deliver on all those fetch quests. Poor babies.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about God is a Geek's glowing review?\" Ah, yes, 75 out of 100 - not bad, not bad at all! They seem to have enjoyed the tough choices and challenging combat. And Hardcore Gamer? That guy loves Broken Roads so much, he wants to marry it (just kidding, but seriously, it's a cult classic in the making).<br><br>And then there's PC Gamer, saying it's only half an amazing game - Hmm, sounds like they wanted more bang for their buck. Finally, Digitally Downloaded gives it a whopping 90 - talk about an Aussie icon!<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, let me tell you - I'm no stranger to harsh critiques myself (just ask my mom). But Broken Roads has something special going on. The moral choices are tough, the world is rich and complex, and those Aussies know how to tell a story.<br><br>Combat might be a bit wonky, and some of the quests can feel like padding (Eurogamer, I'm looking at you), but overall, this game's got heart. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth playing - especially if you're looking for something that'll make you think (and maybe even make you want to learn more about Australia). So go on, take the road less traveled (or in this case, the road that leads to a radioactive wasteland) and experience Broken Roads for yourself. Hippo Penny out!",
