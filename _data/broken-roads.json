    "comment": "Hippo Penny - welcome to the most epic review of Broken Roads ever! I'm not saying that, but seriously, this game has got me feeling like a kangaroo with a joey in its pouch - it's a wild ride!<br><br>As you know, there are plenty of critics who think they're the koala experts when it comes to RPGs. But let me tell you, their reviews are as dry as the Australian outback! Who needs scores and technical jargon when you can have a good ol' fashioned romp in the post-apocalyptic wasteland?<br><br>So, what's all this fuss about Broken Roads? Well, first off, it's got an ambitious morality system that'll keep you wondering if you're the good guy or the bad guy (spoiler alert: you're probably both). The combat might be a bit of a letdown, but hey, who needs shooting at monsters when you can have philosophical debates about the meaning of life in the face of catastrophic collapse? <br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What about the story?\" Well, let me tell you, it's like trying to find water in the desert (it's there, but don't expect a flood!). It's not exactly dripping with excitement, but hey, who needs explosions and action when you can have existential crises?<br><br>In conclusion, Broken Roads is a bit of a mixed bag, but that's what makes it so lovable! It's like a big ol' basket full of eucalyptus leaves - some might be prickly, but others will make your heart skip a beat!<br><br>That's it for today, folks! If you're looking for a game that'll keep you guessing (and not just about what's hiding in the bushes), then Broken Roads is the way to go!",
