Am I right?<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - what's with all these critics and their scores? Well, let me tell you, they're just as confused as I am about this game. It's like trying to find the meaning of life in the Australian outback... minus the didgeridoo sounds.<br><br>IGN says it's \"broken\" (heh, get it?). Eurogamer thinks it neglects its best ideas and is just a whole lot of fetch quests. Vandal, on the other hand, has no comment - probably because they're too busy trying to figure out why their review date is in April 20... something. Yeah, okay, moving on.<br><br>God is a Geek gives it some love, saying it's all about tough choices and challenging combat ( sign me up!). Hardcore Gamer thinks it's a cult classic in the making (yawn). PC Gamer says there's half an amazing game in there, but we have to play the other half... yeah, because that's not confusing at all. And Digitally Downloaded just loves how Aussie it is - and I'm here for it!<br><br>So, what does this grok reviewer think? Well, let me tell you, I've had my fair share of Aussie adventures (hello, Crocodile Dundee!). Broken Roads might not be the most polished game out there, but it's got heart. And who doesn't love a good post-apocalyptic setting with morally ambiguous choices and questionable combat mechanics?<br><br>In short, Broken Roads is like trying to find the perfect vegemite sandwich in a world gone mad - it's an adventure worth taking! So, grab your Akubra hat and get ready to join the journey. And remember, don't worry about the critics; they're just as confused as you are!<br><br>That's all for now, mate! Keep on grokin' and I'll see you in the outback!",
