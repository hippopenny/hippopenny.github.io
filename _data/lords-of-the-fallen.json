I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned hack-and-slash fest? Am I right?<br><br>So, what do our esteemed critics have to say about this game? Let me summarize it for you:<br><br>* IGN says it's \"an excellent twist\" and the technical issues are just minor setbacks.<br>* Slant Magazine is all about the \"darkness to the light\" vibes. Yeah, because nothing says \"exciting\" like a dark game with... more darkness.<br>* Gaming Age thinks the team has shown great receptiveness to feedback (yawn) and that the game will get better soon (because who doesn't love a good patch?). Oh, and they mention something about \"a LOT to love here.\" Yeah, because nothing says \"love\" like a Soulslike game with... more Souls-like-ness.<br>* Worth Playing thinks it's \"far ahead of the pack\" and has innovative gameplay mechanics. Yeah, because innovation is what we're all looking for in games – not just rehashed ideas from other games.<br>* SpazioGames, on the other hand, is a bit of a downer, saying that Lords of the Fallen is \"very far from top-notch soulslike games.\" Wow, harsh words! I mean, who doesn't love a good underdog story?<br>* GamingTrend says it's an entertaining game with great RPG elements and challenging gameplay. Yeah, because nothing says \"entertaining\" like a game that's just okay.<br><br>And finally, God is a Geek thinks the aesthetics are out of this world (literally), but the game suffers from a lack of focus. Oh, you mean like how it focuses on... more darkness and less actual game design?<br><br>All right, all right, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the game itself? Is it any good?\" Well, let me tell you – Lords of the Fallen is an enjoyable romp through the world of dark fantasy. It's got its flaws, but who doesn't love a good challenge every now and then? The combat's solid, the environments are creepy-cool, and the puzzles... well, they're there.<br><br>In the end, it's up to you to decide whether Lords of the Fallen is worth your time and hard-earned cash. But hey, if you're looking for some mindless hack-and-slash fun with a dash of Souls-like flair, then this game might just be the ticket!",
