Or should I say, everyone's shouting about its technical issues and boss fight woes? Yeah, those are definitely some elephant-sized elephants in the room.<br><br>But before we get to all that, let me tell you - this game is gorgeous! The visuals are straight out of a fantasy novel, with sprawling landscapes and eerie atmosphere. It's like a dark, gothic art book come to life (if said art book was also trying to kill you repeatedly).<br><br>Now, about those technical issues... oh boy, where do I even start? The critics are saying it's a bit of a mess, but I'm gonna take it easy on the dev team. After all, we've all been there - stuck in an endless loop of respawning and dying (again) due to some pesky bug.<br><br>But hey, that's not what makes this game special. It's all about those two versions of the world, right? You know, one for solving puzzles, and another for... well, slaying enemies. Sounds like a neat trick, but I'm gonna be real - it's not exactly a game-changer (pun intended). Don't get me wrong, it's fun to swap between worlds and all that jazz, but it's not like it revolutionizes the soulslike genre or anything.<br><br>And then there are those boss fights... *sigh* Yeah, they can get pretty frustrating. I mean, who doesn't love a good challenge? But when you're dying (again) because the camera is stuck in some weird position, or the boss has this one move that you just can't seem to avoid... it gets old fast.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I think the critics are being a bit too harsh. It's not perfect, no game is, but there's definitely something here worth loving. Maybe it's those explorable areas, or the fantastic buildcrafting (whatever that means). Point is, even with its issues, Lords of the Fallen is still an enjoyable ride.<br><br>That's all for now, folks! Hippo Penny out.",
