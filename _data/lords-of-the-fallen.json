Or, in some cases, not talking because they're too busy trying to fix the game's annoying technical issues. Yeah, I'm looking at you, IGN. You said it was a great soulslike with an awesome twist on puzzle-solving and enemy-slaying, but then you had to go and mention those pesky tech problems and weak boss fights. Bummer, dude.<br><br>Anyway, let's get this review rolling. So, what did the critics say? Well, IGN gave it 80% and said it's a \"great soulslike\" with some innovative ideas. Slant Magazine echoed that sentiment, calling it a \"fresh spin on the Soulsborne formula.\" Yeah, I'm loving all these groovy vibes.<br><br>But wait, things take a turn for the worse when we hit up Gaming Age. They gave it 75% and said while it's not bad (phew!), they've got some feedback that'll make or break this game. Something about enemy density, health bars, and checkpoint placements needing some tweaking. Yeah, I'm no expert, but sounds like a to-do list to me.<br><br>Now, Worth Playing gave it 78% and said Lords of the Fallen is ahead of the pack when it comes to Soulslikes. It's got innovative gameplay mechanics, looks good, and innovates. SpazioGames disagreed, giving it 75% and saying it fails to meet its own expectations and ambitions. Ouch, harsh words.<br><br>GamingTrend took a more moderate approach, also giving it 75%. They said it's an entertaining game with great action RPG elements and challenging gameplay. And finally, God is a Geek gave it 80%, praising the aesthetics but lamenting the lack of focus.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I'll let you decide for yourself. But if you're looking for a fun, Souls-like experience with some innovative twists, Lords of the Fallen might just be your jam. Just don't say I didn't warn you about those tech issues.",
