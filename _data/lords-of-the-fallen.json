I mean, besides that one critic who shall remain nameless (cough, cough, SpazioGames). Okay, okay, let's get serious for a sec.<br><br>First off, let's talk about that killer new idea – swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies. It's genius! And it's an excellent twist that sets Lords of the Fallen apart from the pack... or so I thought. Unfortunately, it's hamstrung by numerous, highly annoying technical issues (looking at you, IGN). Weak boss fights? Yeah, those were a real bummer too.<br><br>BUT (and this is a big but), awesome explorable areas and fantastic build-crafting make up for all those shortcomings. I mean, who doesn't love building their own character and exploring a world that's just begging to be discovered?<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the other critics?\" Well, let me tell you, folks, it's like they're all singing from the same hymn sheet (pun intended). Even Slant Magazine got in on the action, calling it a \"fresh spin\" on the Soulsborne formula. And don't even get me started on Gaming Age – that dude is all about positivity! I mean, I'm not sure what kind of magical beans they're smoking over there, but I'll take it!<br><br>So, if you're like me and you're a sucker for quality action-RPGs (despite the obvious overabundance), then Lords of the Fallen is well worth your time. Just be prepared for some technical hiccups along the way.<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny says: go forth and conquer the world... or at least, that's what I'd do if I were a grock in this game!",
