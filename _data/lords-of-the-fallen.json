I've played my fair share of Dark Souls and Sekiro, so when I booted up Lords of the Fallen, I was ready for a challenge. And boy, did it deliver! The game's got some fantastic exploratory areas to uncover, and the buildcrafting system is top-notch.<br><br>But, just like the IGN critic said, those technical issues can be super annoying. I mean, who wants to get stuck on a platform because of poor framerate or experience lengthy load times? Not me, that's for sure.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Is this game worth my time?\" And to that, I say... it depends. If you're a Soulsborne fanboy (or girl), you'll probably love Lords of the Fallen. The combat is satisfying, the world is rich and immersive, and the character customization is a blast.<br><br>But if you're looking for a game without any major hiccups, this might not be the one for you. Yet, as the Gaming Age critic pointed out, the developers have been actively patching out issues and listening to community feedback - so maybe we'll see some of those teething problems ironed out in the near future.<br><br>As for me? I'm just happy to see more games like this coming out. After all, who doesn't love a good challenge?<br><br>And that's my two cents on Lords of the Fallen!",
