Okay, maybe my fellow critics at SpazioGames, but more on that later.<br><br>Let me start by saying that Lords of the Fallen is a great game, flaws and all. IGN agrees with me on this one, praising the game's \"killer new idea\" of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies. And I gotta say, it's a real game-changer (pun intended). But, as we'll get into later, not everything is sunshine and rainbows.<br><br>First off, the gameplay is top-notch. It's got that Soulsborne magic, you know? The combat's satisfying, the exploration's fun, and the buildcrafting is ridiculously addictive. You'll be running around, collecting loot, and upgrading your character in no time. Slant Magazine calls it a \"fresh spin on the Soulsborne formula,\" and I'm right there with them.<br><br>Now, about those flaws. Gaming Age brings up some valid points about the game's performance issues (which have since been patched out). And let me tell you, as someone who's played their fair share of games, it's always a bummer when technical problems get in the way of what could be an otherwise amazing experience.<br><br>But even with those issues, Worth Playing thinks Lords of the Fallen is \"currently far ahead of the pack.\" And I gotta agree. It's a game that innovates and looks good while doing so (God is a Geek agrees, calling the aesthetics \"out of this world\"). Sure, it may not be perfect, but it's definitely worth playing.<br><br>And then there are the critics who just don't get it. SpazioGames thinks the game fails to meet its own ambitions, and I'm like, \"C'mon guys, give it a break!\" It's not that bad! GamingTrend seems to agree, saying it's an entertaining game with great action RPG elements.<br><br>So, what's the takeaway? Lords of the Fallen is a great soulslike game with some flaws, but also some amazing qualities. If you're a fan of these types of games, it's definitely worth checking out. And if you're not, well, maybe this will be the one that converts you into a Soulsborne enthusiast (just don't expect me to hold your hand through it).<br><br>That's my two cents on Lords of the Fallen, folks! What do you think? Have you played the game? Let me know in the comments below! And if not, well, maybe this review will convince you to give it a try.",
