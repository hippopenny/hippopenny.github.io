This reboot aims to bring some fresh spin to the formula, but does it succeed? Let's take a look at what the critics have been saying.<br><br>First off, IGN is feeling pretty positive about this one, giving it an 80 and praising its \"killer new idea\" of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies. Sounds like a blast, right? Well, unfortunately, those tech issues and weak boss fights bring the score down a notch. Still, with awesome explorable areas and fantastic buildcrafting, it's worth your time.<br><br>Slant Magazine is also digging the reboot, calling it \"a fresh spin on the Soulsborne formula that brings darkness to the light.\" Yassss! I mean, who doesn't love a little darkness and light in their soulslike experience?<br><br>Now, Gaming Age is being super optimistic about this one, saying that while it's not perfect, the team has been receptive to feedback and quickly patched out performance issues. They think adjustments will be made, like enemy density and health bars, making the combat more fluid. I love a good underdog story!<br><br>Worth Playing is basically singing the praises of Lords of the Fallen, calling it \"far ahead of the pack\" with its innovative gameplay mechanics. Sure, there are some frustrating design decisions, but overall, this game stands out from the crowd.<br><br>On the other hand, SpazioGames isn't exactly thrilled, giving it a 75 and saying that it fails to meet expectations. With tech issues and gameplay problems, CI Games and HexWorks reboot just can't compete with top-notch soulslike games.<br><br>GamingTrend is more or less on the same page, also giving it an 80. While not perfect, Lords of the Fallen has great action RPG elements and satisfying gameplay.<br><br>Last but not least, God is a Geek agrees that it's an enjoyable, challenging game with amazing aesthetics, but it sometimes lacks focus. Okay, so maybe that's the problem â€“ too much going on at once?<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, I'll have to get my hands dirty and play it for myself. But hey, that's what makes life interesting, right? For now, let's just say that Lords of the Fallen seems like a wild ride with some amazing ideas and areas to explore. Just be prepared for some tech issues and maybe a little bit of frustration.<br><br>That's all for today, folks! Keep on gaming, and remember: Hippo Penny loves you!",
