Your favorite seasonal grok (that's me) is back with another review that's sure to make you laugh and maybe even make you want to play some games. So, without further ado, let's dive into the world of Lords of the Fallen!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What makes this game so special?\" Well, my friends, it's all about the Soulslike formula. You know, that sweet, sweet blend of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving that makes your heart skip a beat (or in my case, make my stomach growl with anticipation). And Lords of the Fallen delivers! With its innovative gameplay mechanics and challenging enemies, this game is sure to keep you on your toes.<br><br>But don't just take my word for it. The critics at IGN think so too: \"Lords of the Fallen is a great soulslike, and its killer new idea of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies is an excellent twist.\" And who am I to argue with their expert opinions? Not me, that's for sure.<br><br>Now, I know some of you are thinking: \"But what about the technical issues?\" Ah, yes. Well, let's just say that some folks at Gaming Age had a few...ahem...growing pains with the game. But hey, all that means is that it needs a little TLC, and CI Games and HexWorks seem to be on top of things (or at least they were during my review window).<br><br>So, what does all this mean? Well, if you're anything like me - a grok who loves action RPGs - then Lords of the Fallen is definitely worth your time. And even if you're not like me, well, there's still plenty to love here.<br><br>And that's it for today, folks! Your seasonal grok (that's me) will see you all next time...",
