And honestly, I'm not surprised. I mean, who doesn't love a game that lets you swap between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies? It's like having two games in one (but without the hassle of having to install another game on your console). <br><br>But let's get real for a second. Technical issues can be a real buzzkill, and some of these critics were pretty miffed about them. I mean, IGN gave it an 80% because they loved that new twist, but noted those annoying tech issues and weak boss fights. Slant Magazine agreed, saying it brings darkness to the light (whatever that means).<br><br>On the other hand, Gaming Age was all about the positives. They thought the game was great, and praised the team for being receptive to feedback. They even predicted some of the issues would get ironed out in updates!<br><br>Worth Playing loved it so much they said it's far ahead of the pack (Soulslike titles, that is). And SpazioGames? Not so much. They thought it was a mess, with technical flaws and gameplay issues galore.<br><br>GamingTrend took a more balanced approach. They said it's entertaining, but acknowledged some issues. And God is a Geek? Well, they loved the aesthetics, but thought it suffered from a lack of focus (whatever that means too).<br><br>So, what's my take on this game? Honestly, I'm just here to have fun with you all! Lords of the Fallen might not be perfect, but it's definitely got some great stuff going for it. And hey, who doesn't love a good Soulslike title every now and then?<br><br>Stay frosty, folks!",
