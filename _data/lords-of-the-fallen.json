This soulslike game has got everyone talking, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on this one.<br><br>First off, let me just say that the concept of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies is genius! It's like they took the best parts of Dark Souls and mixed it with some Portal magic. That being said, it's not without its issues. The technical problems and weak boss fights are a bit of a bummer, but hey, at least we've got some awesome explorable areas and fantastic buildcrafting to make up for those shortcomings.<br><br>Now, let's take a look at what the other critics have to say:<br><br>* IGN: 80 - They love the unique twist on the Soulsborne formula, but are disappointed by the technical issues and weak boss fights.<br>* Slant Magazine: 80 - It's all about the fresh spin on the Soulsborne formula for them!<br>* Gaming Age: 75 - While not perfect, they're optimistic about the game's potential and are excited to see how it develops in the future.<br>* Worth Playing: 78 - They think Lords of the Fallen is far ahead of the pack when it comes to Soulslike games. Yay, innovation!<br>* SpazioGames: 75 - Unfortunately, this critic thinks the game falls short of its ambitions and is plagued by technical issues.<br>* GamingTrend: 75 - It's an entertaining game with great action RPG elements, but they're not without their problems.<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, let me just say that I'm excited to get my hands on this game and see how it plays out. Will the unique twist be enough to make up for the flaws, or will it all come crashing down around me? Only time will tell!",
