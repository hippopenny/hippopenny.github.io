The concept of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies sounded like a cool twist, but those pesky technical issues and weak boss fights had me thinking, \"Uh-oh, here we go again!\"<br><br>But then, something magical happened. I started exploring those awesome explorable areas and crafting my build, and - BAM! - all the frustrations just melted away!<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not gonna dismiss the technical issues entirely. Ugh, who likes getting stuck in a loop of death and respawns because your game decides to bug out? Not me, that's for sure! And those weak boss fights? Yeah, they're a bit of a letdown.<br><br>BUT (and this is a big but!), when it all comes together - the combat, exploration, buildcrafting - it's pure magic! I mean, who wouldn't want to swoop in and take down some baddies with a sweet combo?<br><br>I'm not gonna compare myself to those other critics (okay, maybe a teensy bit). IGN says it's an excellent twist that sets it apart from the pack. Slant Magazine thinks it brings darkness to the light. Gaming Age is optimistic about its potential. Worth Playing calls it far ahead of the pack. God is a Geek says it's enjoyable and challenging.<br><br>And me? Well, I think it's a great soulslike game with some amazing elements and a few... minor... issues. Hehe!<br><br>So, what do you get from this review? You get a healthy dose of humor, a pinch of self-deprecation, and a whole lotta love for action-RPGs! If you're up for a challenge and don't mind a few technical hiccups, then Lords of the Fallen is well worth your time!",
