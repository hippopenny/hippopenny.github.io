It's your boy, the grok-iest reviewer around, back with another review that'll make you laugh and possibly make you cry (but only if you're really invested in the Soulslike genre).<br><br>So, let's get to it: Lords of the Fallen. This game is like that one friend who always promises to bring the snacks, but they never quite follow through. You know, they're like, \"Hey, I've got some awesome ideas, bro!\" But then you play the game, and it's all, \"Yeah, about those ideas...\". Yeah, it's a Soulslike game with some killer new features, but also some major drawbacks.<br><br>Now, I'm not here to trash-talk the devs (CI Games and HexWorks), because hey, they're trying, and that counts for something. And let's be real, even the most seasoned gamers love a good Soulsborne experience. But when you're playing Lords of the Fallen, it's like riding a bike with square wheels â€“ it looks cool, but you'll probably crash.<br><br>The swapping between two versions of the world (because who doesn't want to see the same level from different angles?) is an excellent twist. It's like having two games in one, and I'm all about that. But then there are the technical issues. Oh boy, the tech problems. You know when you're trying to solve a puzzle or take down some bad guys, and suddenly your character just freezes? Yeah, that happens here.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But wait, Hippo Penny, what about the awesome explorable areas and fantastic buildcrafting?\" And listen, those are indeed some of the best parts of the game. It's like having a giant LEGO set in your hands, minus the satisfaction of actually building something with it.<br><br>So, where does that leave us? Well, if you're like me and love Soulslikes, then Lords of the Fallen is worth checking out. Just don't expect too much from the tech side, or you might end up like me: laughing at my own screen while my character gets stuck on a wall for the 10th time.<br><br>All jokes aside, it's nice to see some of these critics (ahem, IGN) praising the game for its innovative gameplay and great buildcrafting. And hey, who doesn't love an underdog? So, if you're looking for a new Soulslike adventure with a dash of something different, Lords of the Fallen might just be the game for you.<br><br>But don't quote me on that; I'm just a grok-ful reviewer trying to make it in this crazy gaming world.",
