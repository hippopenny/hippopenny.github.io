I mean, who doesn't love a good puzzle-solving, demon-slaying adventure?<br><br>As I ventured through the realms of Agartha (which is just a fancy name for \"dark and foreboding landscape\"), I noticed the critics were having a field day with this game. IGN thought it was \"great\" but hamstrung by tech issues and weak boss fights. Slant Magazine simply said, \"it brings darkness to the light.\" Ah, how... illuminating.<br><br>Gaming Age gave it a 75, saying it's not perfect but has room for improvement. They mentioned some performance issues on PC (which I'm sure were fixed with a quick patch, wink-wink). Worth Playing thought it was the best Soulslike game of the year, with innovative gameplay mechanics and great visuals. SpazioGames wasn't so keen, calling it \"very far from top-notch\" soulslikes. And GamingTrend just said it's an entertaining game with some issues.<br><br>As for me? Well, I'm here to give you the lowdown on the game play. You know what's great about Lords of the Fallen? The swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies is pure genius! It's like having a mini- Portal within a Soulslike game – who wouldn't love that?<br><br>The action-RPG elements are top-notch, with challenging but satisfying combat. And when you're not busy fighting demons, you can explore those awesome explorable areas and craft your character to the nines. I mean, what's not to like?<br><br>Of course, there are some issues. Like how sometimes the game feels like it's lacking focus (God is a Geek agrees on this one). But hey, that's just part of the Soulslike package, right? It's all about perseverance and... well, not dying too much.<br><br>So, if you're looking for an action-packed RPG with some fresh twists and turns, Lords of the Fallen might be your jam. Just don't expect it to be perfect – after all, we're talking about a Soulslike game here.",
