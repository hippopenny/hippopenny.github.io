Now, I know what you're thinking - another Soulslike game, how exciting can it be? Well, let me tell you, this one's got some twists that'll keep you hooked.<br><br>First off, kudos to CI Games and HexWorks for shaking things up with their take on the Souls formula. The ability to swap between two versions of the world is a genius move - it adds a whole new layer of depth to exploration and combat. I mean, who doesn't love a good mystery, right?<br><br>Now, I know some of my fellow critics have been a bit harsh on Lords of the Fallen's technical issues. And yeah, they're a nuisance. But let's be real, folks - we've all played games with the occasional lag or texture glitch. It's not the end of the world.<br><br>What really gets me excited is the game's buildcrafting system. I mean, who doesn't love crafting and building their own stuff in a game? It's like being the ultimate tinkerer! And let me tell you, it's super satisfying to build your own character and watch them grow.<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna lie - some of my fellow critics have been a bit harsh on Lords of the Fallen. IGN gave it an 80, but said it was \"hamstrung by numerous, highly annoying technical issues.\" Ouch! Slant Magazine was more optimistic, saying it brought \"darkness to the light\" (whatever that means). Gaming Age gave it a solid 75, praising its receptiveness to feedback and potential for improvement. Worth Playing loved it, saying it's \"far ahead of the pack.\" SpazioGames, on the other hand, called it \"very far from top notch soulslike games.\" Okay, so maybe don't take their opinion too seriously.<br><br>All in all, Lords of the Fallen is a fun ride with some great twists and turns. If you're a fan of Soulslikes or just looking for a good action RPG, this one's definitely worth checking out. Just don't expect it to be perfect - no game is!",
