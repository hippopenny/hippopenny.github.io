With scores ranging from 50 to 98, it's clear this game has sparked some strong opinions.<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm obsessed with Loop Hero. Like, I-can't-stop-playing-it-even-though-I-know-I-should-be-doing-other-things obsessed. And I think you will be too! But before we get to all the fun stuff, let's take a look at what some of the other critics have had to say.<br><br>Hooked Gamers gave it a whopping 98% and said: \"I can think of no higher praise than to admit that even as I write this review, I have Loop Hero playing in the background.\" Yeah, we're talking serious addiction potential here!<br><br>Gamer Escape agreed with an 90%, praising the game's creative story and overall aesthetic. They also noted that it's a great fit for retro and roguelike/lite fans.<br><br>COGconnected gave it an 88%, mentioning their love for the Necromancer class (who can blame them, right?). And Everyeye.it chimed in with an 82%, calling it a \"rich, disruptive, and worthy of discovery experience.\"<br><br>But don't worry, not everyone was completely won over. IGN and Hey Poor Player both gave it an 80%, praising its unique concept and addictive gameplay, but also noting that some aspects could be tweaked for improvement.<br><br>And then there's Edge Magazine, which was a bit more...underwhelmed with its 50%. They felt the game got a little too repetitive and that the theming wore off after a while. (Zzz...yawn?)<br><br>So, what about me? Well, I'm just going to come right out and say it: I LOVE Loop Hero! The way you can build your own little world by summoning creatures and building structures is so satisfying. And don't even get me started on the Necromancer class â€“ those skeletons are adorable!<br><br>But in all seriousness, this game has got something special going for it. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and depth, with a dash of dark humor thrown in (because who doesn't love a little apocalypse-themed fun?). So, if you're looking for a new adventure to sink your teeth into, I highly recommend giving Loop Hero a try.<br><br>Hippo out!",
