So, let's get to it!<br><br>PC Gamer says Wild Bastards is a modern marvel of game design, combining roguelike and FPS elements in a way that'll make you shout, \"How did they do it?!\". Score: 91. I mean, no pressure or anything.<br><br>Digital Chumps gives us the lowdown - short, intense shootouts with some serious strategy thrown in. It's not your grandma's shooter! Score: 90. Grandma approved!<br><br>The Games Machine chimes in, \"But what's this Wild Bastards thing about?\" Well, let 'em tell it - it's all about pleasant gameplay, detailed design, and a gunplay system that'll keep you hooked! Score: 83. I guess grandma could approve after all.<br><br>Twinfinite's review is a bit of a downer, though. They say Wild Bastards tries to mix things up too much and loses steam in the end. Ouch! Score: 80. Tough crowd, man!<br><br>GameSkinny thinks it's almost there, but that pesky endgame issue holds it back. Almost, but not quite... Score: 70. You can almost taste victory!<br><br>Shacknews says Wild Bastards has style and charm aplenty, with a decent-sized character roster to boot! It's a wild ride, but don't get too comfortable - things start to fade after a while. Score: 70. Don't worry, we're all just waiting for the DLC to fix that!<br><br>And lastly, GamesRadar+ drops the bombshell - Wild Bastards is like playing in outer space without a spacesuit! Too much novely, not enough substance, and before you know it, credits are rolling, man! Score: 40. Yeah, no thanks, I'll stick to my trusty spaceship!<br><br>Whew! What a wild ride indeed! Which critic's take resonates with you the most?",
