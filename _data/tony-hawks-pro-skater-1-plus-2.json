Who isn't, right? But seriously, these remastered classics have got everyone from IGN to Cheat Code Central singing their praises.<br><br>So, what makes THPS 1 + 2 such a rad ride? For starters, the gameplay is as smooth as ever. You know those old-school tricks that'll get you comboing like a boss? Yeah, they're still there, and they're still ridiculously fun. The new challenges, gear, and characters add some fresh flavor to the mix without straying too far from what made the originals so great.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, what about the visuals?\" Well, let me tell you – this game looks like a straight-up masterpiece. Those old-school levels are lovingly remade with modern flair, and the soundtrack? Ah, man... it's like an old friend welcoming you back with open arms.<br><br>But here's the thing: I'm not just some nostalgia-obsessed critic (ahem, IGN). I'm also a bit of a skeptic. So, what do I think about these remasters? Well, let me just say that – in my humble opinion – Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is basically perfect. It's a loving nod to the past while still offering plenty of new and exciting stuff to keep things fresh.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not gonna sugarcoat it – there might be some minor drawbacks. For example, some critics have noted that the load times can be a bit lengthy, but let's be real: this game is so good, you won't even notice. And hey, what's a few extra seconds when you're having this much fun?<br><br>All in all, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is an absolute blast. If you were a fan of the originals, this remastered collection will transport you back to those carefree days of skateboarding bliss. And if you're new to the series? Well, you're in for a treat! With its timeless gameplay, gorgeous visuals, and rad soundtrack, this game is sure to capture your attention – and keep you coming back for more.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, let me just say that I'm not gonna leave it up to the critics (ahem, Game Informer). Nah, man – if you haven't already, go grab a copy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 and get ready to have your mind blown by this incredible remastered experience. Trust me, bro – it's totally worth it!",
