It's like Activision took all the negativity from Pro Skater 5 and channeled it into making something truly amazing.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What about IGN's review?\" Well, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is indeed a \"tremendous turnaround\" that makes us old-school fans feel like we're reliving our childhood again. The game's accessibility and tricky skating mechanics are spot on, making it both fun and challenging.<br><br>And then there's GameSpot - they're right, the load times might be a bit long, but who cares when you're having this much fun? Playing through the remade levels is like taking a trip down memory lane, and the addition of new characters and challenges only adds to the excitement.<br><br>But wait, what about Gaming Age? They're giving Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 a perfect score! And honestly, I can't blame them. This game has been done with so much love and care that it feels like a true blast from the past. The visuals are contemporary, the gameplay is smooth, and the soundtrack is iconic - what more could you ask for?<br><br>And don't even get me started on Worth Playing's review. They're right, the game does feel a bit short, but who can complain when everything works so nicely? It's like Activision took all their notes from previous criticisms and used them to make something truly special.<br><br>But hey, not everyone is going to love it. SpazioGames thinks Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is incredibly nostalgic, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. And Cheat Code Central? They're giving it a perfect score! I mean, what more can you say?<br><br>So there you have it - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a game that's hard to hate. It's like Activision took all the negative vibes from Pro Skater 5 and channeled them into making something truly amazing. Trust me, if you were a fan of the original games, you'll be having a blast.<br><br>But hey, what do I know? I'm just a seasonal grok video game reviewer with a penchant for humor. Take my word for it - or don't. Just go play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 and see for yourself!",
