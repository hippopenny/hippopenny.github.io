I mean, who wouldn't want to relive those radical days of skate culture and iconic music? It's like a time machine for your thumbs! <br><br>Now, let me tell you – the critics have been raving about this game (and I'm not just talking about the ones on IGN or GameSpot). Even the usually skeptical folks at Worth Playing couldn't help but praise its nostalgic charm.<br><br>But what makes Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 truly shine is how it balances retro flair with modern polish. Vicarious Visions has done an amazing job of bringing these classic games into the present, adding some sweet new features along the way (like those lovely levels and that fabulous soundtrack).<br><br>Of course, there are some minor complaints about load times or level goals, but hey, who's complaining when you can pull off sick combos and skate through nostalgia-fueled levels?<br><br>Gaming Age put it best: this remaster is \"one of the best remasters available on the market today.\" And I'd agree. It's a testament to the power of classic gaming to captivate new audiences while still holding onto its original magic.<br><br>So, if you haven't already, grab your board and hit those virtual streets – Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is an absolute blast!",
