I'm here to spill my thoughts on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, and boy, do I have some fun to share with you all!<br><br>First off, kudos to Vicarious Visions for whipping up a remastered masterpiece that has us old-school skaters feeling like we're back in the '90s, minus the questionable fashion choices (thankfully). These games are so well-crafted that even your average gamer will be hooked. It's like a warm hug from the past, folks!<br><br>Now, some of my fellow critics might say I'm being too kind (hello, IGN and GameSpot!), but honestly, who doesn't love a good skate-fest? The accessible gameplay is perfect for newbies and pros alike - you can zip through levels with ease or go all in on those tricky combos. And those visuals? On point! It's like looking at a freshly waxed skateboard ( minus the inevitable scratches).<br><br>The music, oh boy, the music! It's like someone put the entire '90s playlist into one glorious package. You'll be singing along to those iconic tunes in no time!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What about level goals?\" Well, let me tell you, my friends, this is where Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 truly shines. You can play through levels as many times as you want, and it's all good! It's like having your favorite video game rental store (remember those?) without the pesky late fees.<br><br>In short, if you're looking for a blast from the past with some modern flair, look no further than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. Your inner '90s kid will thank you!<br><br>P.S. To all my fellow critics out there (I'm looking at you, Worth Playing!), I say - take a page from Vicarious Visions' book and focus on the fun!",
