I'm back with another review that's sure to make you laugh and maybe even want to grab your board (or controller)!<br><br>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has been getting a lot of love lately, and for good reason. It's like going back in time, but with better graphics and more features! But let's be real, it's not just about the nostalgia – it's about the gameplay.<br><br>Now, I know some critics have been saying that this game is all about going back to the past, but I think that's a bit harsh. Sure, it pays homage to the original games, but it also brings new tricks and challenges to the table (or should I say, halfpipe?). The level design is lovingly crafted, with nods to the classic games that we all love.<br><br>And let's not forget about the music! It's like a big ol' hug for your ears. Who wouldn't want to jam out to some sick tunes while they're shredding it on their board?<br><br>But hey, I'm not here to gush (too much) about the game – I'm here to give you my two cents. And honestly, if you loved the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, then this one is a must-play. If you didn't grow up with them, well, it's still super fun and worth checking out.<br><br>And hey, what's not to love? The IGN reviewer said it best – \"It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years.\" Yaaas, that is some good stuff!<br><br>Anyway, if you're looking for a game that's all about fun, nostalgia, and sick tricks, then Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is the way to go. Trust me, you won't regret it.<br><br>That's it for now, folks! See you in the next review!",
