It's your buddy here, reviewing the latest and greatest in gaming - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Why should I care about a game that came out in the PlayStation era?\" Well, my friend, let me tell you - this remaster is no ordinary rehashing of old games. It's like a warm hug from your childhood, wrapped in modern graphics and new features.<br><br>IGN says it best: \"The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old-school fun...\" And I couldn't agree more! The gameplay is still as addictive as ever, with the perfect blend of realism and arcade flair. You'll find yourself trying to one-up your friends (or, you know, your AI opponents) and pulling off sick tricks in no time.<br><br>But it's not just about the gameplay - oh no, the levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music? It's like an old childhood buddy, welcoming you back with open arms. GameSpot agrees: \"Playing through the newly remade levels is immensely enjoyable...\" And I'm right there with them!<br><br>Now, I know some of my fellow critics might say that it's a little too nostalgic, that it doesn't take enough risks. But hey, when something's this good, who cares? Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has the perfect blend of old-school charm and modern flair. It's like a time machine for your thumbs!<br><br>In conclusion: Hippo Penny gives this game four skateboards out of five! (Don't ask me how I came up with that score, it's a secret only my fellow critics know).<br><br>P.S. - If you're wondering what the other critics think, well... IGN gave it a 90, GameSpot gave it a 90, and Gaming Age gave it a 100! (But don't worry, I'm not biased or anything).",
