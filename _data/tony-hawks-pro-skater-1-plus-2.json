I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned skateboarding game? The IGN critic seems to agree, calling it \"tremendous\" and saying it's \"old-school fun.\" Meanwhile, GameSpot thinks it nails the original experience, but has some minor downsides.<br><br>Game Informer gives it two thumbs up, saying it feels fresh and current. And don't even get me started on Gaming Age - they're giving it a perfect score! Even Worth Playing is impressed, despite being a bit disappointed by the lack of level goals for every skater (boo!).<br><br>But what really gets my goat is all these critics saying it's \"nostalgic\" and \"a blast from the past.\" Duh, yeah! It's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, folks! That means it's a game that's all about reliving the good ol' days of skateboarding glory. And if you didn't grow up on this series, well, don't worry - SpazioGames says it's still a modern experience.<br><br>In short, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is like a tubular time machine that whisks you back to the good times. It's all about having fun and shredding the gnar (or not). So grab your board, put on some sick tunes, and get ready to catch some air!<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to try out this new \"Wallplant\" trick...",
