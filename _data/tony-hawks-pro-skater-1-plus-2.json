Well, let me just say that this remastered edition of the classic skateboarding game has got me feeling like a kid again, trying to land that perfect combo. And trust me, it's not just nostalgia talking!<br><br>So, what makes this game so special? For starters, Vicarious Visions (the developers) have done an incredible job of bringing back the magic of the original games while still making it feel fresh and current. The visuals are smooth, the gameplay is as fun as ever, and the iconic soundtrack will have you singing along in no time.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Isn't this just a rehashing of old games?\" Well, not exactly! While the core experience remains the same, there's plenty new to get excited about. The level goals are back, but now they come with new challenges and incentives to keep you coming back for more. And let's not forget the multiplayer - it's like the ultimate skate party!<br><br>Now, I'm sure some of my fellow critics might say that this game is just a rehashing of old ideas, but I gotta disagree. This is more than just a blast from the past; it's a celebration of what makes Tony Hawk's Pro Skater so special in the first place. And if you ask me, that's something worth getting excited about!<br><br>All in all, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is an absolute must-play for anyone who's ever loved skateboarding (or just loves fun games period). So grab your board and get ready to shred!",
