And by that, I mean, they made it better. Like, really good.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Seasonal Grok, why should I care about some old skateboarding game?\" Well, let me tell you, this isn't just some old game. This is a blast from the past that's been remade for the modern era. It's like looking at old photos of your childhood home and suddenly remembering all the good times.<br><br>The critics are in agreement - it's a great game. IGN gave it 90 points, saying it's \"old-school fun\" with \"lovingly designed levels.\" GameSpot agreed, saying it's an \"experience that's more than just a brief skate through Tony Hawk's past.\" And don't even get me started on Gaming Age, who gave it a perfect score and said it's one of the best remasters out there.<br><br>Now, I'm not here to repeat what everyone else has said. I'll give you my own take - this game is a lot of fun. It's like playing with your childhood friends all over again, except now they're all super-skilled and you have to keep up. The levels are challenging but not frustratingly so, the music is catchy (I mean, it's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater - what did you expect?), and the graphics are top-notch.<br><br>The only thing I can criticize is that maybe, just maybe, they could've taken a few more risks with the gameplay. But honestly, who needs risk when you're having this much fun? It's like playing with your old favorite toy - you know exactly what to expect, but it never gets old.<br><br>So, if you haven't played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 yet, do yourself a favor and grab it. Trust me, you won't regret it.",
