I mean, who wouldn't want to revisit the classic skateboarding experience that launched a thousand ollies? The game has been re-mastered (get it?) and is now available on modern consoles.<br><br>Let's get to the good stuff! IGN called it \"old-school fun\" with \"lovingly designed\" levels that are like a warm hug from your childhood. GameSpot said it \"nails\" the original experience, making it hard not to be sour about Activision's business strategy (zing!). Even Game Informer got in on the action, saying it feels fresh and current with contemporary visuals.<br><br>But what really gets me pumped is when critics start getting a little too full of themselves. I mean, who doesn't love a good underdog story? Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was... um, not great, shall we say (read: a dumpster fire). So, for the game to turn around like this is nothing short of impressive.<br><br>Worth Playing said it's got plenty of challenges and online multiplayer, but also acknowledged that you can probably clear every stage in one afternoon. That's okay! Who needs more than an hour of skateboarding fun?<br><br>Cheat Code Central went all out, calling it a \"perfect remaster\" with extra tasks and incentives to keep going back for more. And SpazioGames summed it up perfectly: it's nostalgic but modern.<br><br>In short, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a blast from the past that feels like a bright future. So grab your board (or controller) and get ready to ride!",
