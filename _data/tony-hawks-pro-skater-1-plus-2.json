As I dive into this remastered masterpiece, I'm reminded of my own skateboarding days (okay, so I mostly watched others skate while eating Cheetos) and the thrill of attempting those sick tricks. And let me tell you, this game has aged like a fine pair of Vans - it's still got that old-school charm!<br><br>The critics are raving about it too! IGN gushes over how the game \"nails\" the original Tony Hawk experience, while GameSpot praises the \"satisfying combos\" and engaging challenge system. Even Game Informer chimes in, saying the title feels \"fresh and current.\" But what really gets me is that Gaming Age gave it a perfect score! I mean, what more could you ask for?<br><br>Now, as I play through Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, I'm struck by how smoothly the game glides (pun intended) between its nostalgic charm and modern polish. The levels are lovingly remade, with just the right amount of retro flair. And don't even get me started on the music - it's like a sonic hug from my childhood!<br><br>Of course, no game is perfect, and some critics do have minor gripes (Worth Playing says it could've taken more risks). But overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a triumphant return to form for the series. It's a blast from the past that still feels like a fresh start.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a game that will transport you back to the '90s (or, at the very least, give you a rad time) - look no further than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2! Just don't forget your Cheetos.",
