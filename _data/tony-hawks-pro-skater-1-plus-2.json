It's your old buddy here, back with another review that's sure to make you laugh, cry, and maybe even want to play some sick skateboard tricks (but not too many, because, you know, safety first).<br><br>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is the kind of game that makes you nostalgic for the good ol' days when gaming was all about fun, friends, and flippin' boards. And let me tell you, this remaster does the original justice. Like IGN said, it's a \"tremendous turnaround\" from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 (RIP).<br><br>But seriously, what makes this game stand out is its attention to detail. From the lovingly designed levels that'll transport you back to the early days of gaming, to the soundtrack that's like an old childhood buddy giving you a warm hug, everything feels like it was made with love and care.<br><br>Now, I know some critics might say, \"But what about the load times?\" or \"What about the lack of level goals for every skater?\" To which I say, \"Pffft, who needs those things when you're having this much fun?\" GameSpot agrees, saying that even with its downsides, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a success.<br><br>And let's not forget about the gameplay. It's still as smooth and satisfying as ever, making it easy to get lost in the world of skateboarding. Even Gaming Age, who gave it a perfect score (100, folks!), said that the game \"does an excellent job of retaining the spirit and feel of the PlayStation era classics.\"<br><br>But don't just take their word for it. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a must-play for anyone who grew up with the series or is just looking for a fun, retro gaming experience. So grab your board, put on some sick tunes, and get ready to shred like it's 1999!",
