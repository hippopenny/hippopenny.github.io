Now, before we get started, let me just say that I'm not exactly the most... shall we say, \"seasoned\" gamer out there. But hey, who needs experience when you've got a healthy dose of skepticism and a whole lot of humor, right?<br><br>Now, where were we? Ah yes, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2! So, it seems like the good folks at Vicarious Visions have taken the original games from yesteryear – Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 – and given them a modern makeover. And, boy, do they ever look good!<br><br>But enough about graphics; let's get down to business! The gameplay, oh boy... it's like riding a skateboard (or in my case, flailing around like a drunken giraffe on wheels). Smooth, buttery controls make it a breeze to pull off those sick tricks and combos. And with the addition of new features like challenges, gear, and online multiplayer, there's plenty to keep you coming back for more.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – \"Grog, why are you making such a big deal about this?\" Well, my friends, it's because Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is one of those rare remasters that truly earns its place in the pantheon of gaming greatness. It's like that friend who still remembers all the good old times, but also knows how to adapt to the modern world.<br><br>So, what do the other critics have to say about this nostalgic gem? Well, let me tell you – IGN says it's \"a tremendous turnaround\" from those darker days of Pro Skater 5. GameSpot calls it a \"success\" thanks to its engaging challenge system and smooth gameplay. And Gaming Age gives it a perfect score, saying it's one of the best remasters out there!<br><br>Of course, not everyone is as effusive in their praise (I mean, who is?). Worth Playing notes that while it's great, it could've taken more risks. SpazioGames says it's both nostalgic and modern at the same time. And then there's Cheat Code Central, which simply states that it's \"a perfect remaster.\"<br><br>But hey, I'm not here to argue with those critics (although, let me tell you, some of them can be pretty... spirited). No way! I'm here to have a blast talking about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. So, grab your board, dust off those old skills, and get ready to shred the gnar!<br><br>That's it for today, folks! Hippo Penny out!",
