And let me tell you, this game is like a warm hug for your nostalgia-filled heart (or in my case, a sweet pair of Vans).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What about the other critics?\" Well, let's get into it! IGN gave it a 90, saying it's a \"tremendous turnaround\" from the previous games. GameSpot also scored it 90, praising its ability to nail the original experience. Even Game Informer got in on the action, giving it an 88 and calling it a \"blast from the past.\"<br><br>But what about Gaming Age? They gave it a perfect score - 100! They praised the game's ability to retain the spirit of the classics while adding new features and music.<br><br>And don't even get me started on Worth Playing, who gave it a 90. They loved the challenges, gear, characters, and online multiplayer. But they did mention that it could've taken a few more risks... minor gripe, if you ask me!<br><br>Cheat Code Central? Yep, they gave it a whopping 98! They loved everything about it - the remastering, the new tasks, the customization options... the list goes on.<br><br>Last but not least, SpazioGames gave it a 90. They praised its ability to be nostalgic while still being modern.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, I'm gonna say this game is a total rad- fest! (Sorry, had to). Seriously though, if you're a fan of the series or just looking for some sick skateboarding action, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is definitely worth your time.<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to grab my board and hit the streets...",
