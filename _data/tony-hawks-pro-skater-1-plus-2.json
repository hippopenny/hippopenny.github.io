Before we dive in, let me just say that I'm no skateboarding expert. In fact, I've never even been on a skateboard without wiping out spectacularly. But hey, who needs skills when you have nostalgia-fueled gameplay?<br><br>The critics are having a field day with this game, and rightly so! It's a love letter to the original games, with a healthy dose of modern flair. The pros (see what I did there?) from the previous games return, feeling fresh and feisty as ever. New talents join the fold, making for an excitingly eclectic soundtrack that'll have you singing along in no time.<br><br>CGMagazine calls it \"near perfection\" – and I'm like, yeah, sure thing! Who needs original content when you can just remaster some old classics? Just kidding ( sort of). The point is, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 nails the feel-good factor. It's a blast to play, with addictive gameplay that'll have you shredding for hours on end.<br><br>We Got This Covered raves about the game's revitalization of classic games – and honestly, who can blame them? There's something special about revisiting childhood favorites with a modern twist. It's like putting on your favorite old shoes that still fit perfectly (you know what I mean).<br><br>Vgames gets all misty-eyed talking about good ol' times when games were just plain fun – no fancy story modes or over-the-top voice acting needed! Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 takes this mantra to heart, delivering an unapologetically fun experience that's hard to put down.<br><br>Game Informer chimes in, praising the game's fresh visuals, smooth gameplay, and iconic soundtrack (which, let's be real, is a major selling point for me). They think this blast-from-the-past could revitalize the franchise – I'm not disagreeing!<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, GameSkinny feels like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 makes good on its promise, but doesn't quite land all its modern twists. Hey, no one's perfect, right?<br><br>Last but not least, Jeuxvideo.com thinks the game could've used a little more to leave an impression. I get it – sometimes you just need that extra oomph! But hey, the pleasure and sensations are still there (I think they mean the skateboarding parts... or maybe the cosmetic items?).<br><br>So what's my verdict? Well, since I'm no pro reviewer (see what I did there again?), I'll just leave it to your imagination. You know what I love about this game? The sheer nostalgia trip it is! Who wouldn't want to relive those halcyon days of gaming goodness?<br><br>That's it for Hippo Penny's review – see you in the next one, folks!",
