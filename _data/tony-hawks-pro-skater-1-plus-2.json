It's your boy back with another review that's gonna make you wanna grab your board and hit the streets!<br><br>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has dropped, and let me tell you - it's a blast from the past that'll get you feeling like you're skating through time. The reviews are in, and the critics are saying it's a game-changer (pun intended). IGN gave it a 90, praising its \"accessible yet tricky\" gameplay and lovingly designed levels. GameSpot also chimed in with a 90, citing the satisfaction of pulling off combos and the engaging challenge system.<br><br>Game Informer weighed in with an 88, saying that the game's visuals, smooth gameplay, and iconic soundtrack make it feel fresh and current. And Gaming Age? They gave it a perfect score (100!), praising its excellent job of retaining the spirit and feel of the PlayStation era classics while adding new features, music, and options.<br><br>But don't just take their word for it - I've got my own two wheels to share with you. The gameplay is still as rad as ever, and the addition of new features like challenges and online multiplayer are a great way to mix things up. And let's be real, who doesn't love reliving those classic levels?<br><br>Of course, there are some minor gripes - Worth Playing pointed out that the game could've taken more risks, while Cheat Code Central just called it \"perfect.\" SpazioGames summed it up nicely: \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is a title that manages to be incredibly nostalgic, but it's a modern experience at the same time.\"<br><br>So what are you waiting for? Get ready to have your sk8 on and relive some of the most iconic moments in gaming history. Trust me, this remaster is worth checking out - even if you're not a seasoned pro like Tony Hawk himself!<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
