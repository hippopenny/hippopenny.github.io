But seriously, this remastered version has got it all: smooth gameplay, iconic soundtrack, and level designs that will transport you back to the good ol' days of gaming.<br><br>Now, let's get to what the critics are saying. IGN calls it a \"tremendous turnaround\" from 2015's Pro Skater 5, which is quite the understatement. I mean, who would have thought that going backwards (in terms of game development) would be the best step forward for Activision? GameSpot agrees, praising the game for \"nailing so much about that original Tony Hawk experience.\" And honestly, what more could you ask for?<br><br>Game Informer thinks it's a \"blast from the past\" that will make you feel like a kid again. And Gaming Age, well, they're just gushing over it: \"one of the best remasters available on the market today.\" Even Worth Playing has some nice things to say, calling it a \"lot of fun\" despite having some minor downsides.<br><br>Now, I'm not one for hyperbole (okay, maybe I am), but Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is indeed a masterclass in nostalgia. And as someone who didn't exactly grow up with the series (I mean, I was still playing Pac-Man and Donkey Kong back then... just kidding, I wasn't that old), I can confidently say it's an absolute blast to play.<br><br>In conclusion, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a must-play for anyone who loves skate culture, nostalgia, or just wants to experience some good ol' fashioned fun. And if you don't like it... well, you're probably a critic from the '90s who still thinks Game Boy is the best thing since sliced bread.<br><br>Review Date: September 2020 (just kidding, I didn't actually review it in September 2020).",
