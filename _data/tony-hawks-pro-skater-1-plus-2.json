This remastered gem is like a warm hug from your favorite childhood game - it's familiar, yet fresh, and packed with more tricks than a skatepark on a sunny Saturday morning.<br><br>The critics are unanimous in their praise - IGN gave it a 90, GameSpot said it was \"really hard to be mad at\" (awww), and Gaming Age awarded it a perfect score. Even the cynics at Worth Playing couldn't help but acknowledge that this is a great game, despite some minor drawbacks.<br><br>But what makes Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 truly special? For starters, it's old-school fun - think challenging combos, rad levels to explore, and an iconic soundtrack that'll have you singing along. And yet, it's also a modern experience, with smooth gameplay, contemporary visuals, and new features like online multiplayer.<br><br>Gaming Age sums it up best: \"This is easily one of the best remasters available on the market today... The gameplay is still timeless and is sure to capture the attention of a whole new era of skateboarding fans.\"<br><br>So if you're looking for a game that'll transport you back to the good ol' days, but also deliver a fresh experience, look no further. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is the perfect blend of nostalgia and innovation - grab your board and get ready to shred!",
