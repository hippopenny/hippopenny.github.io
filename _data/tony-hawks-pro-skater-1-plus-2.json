Am I right, folks?<br><br>Now, let me just say that these other critics are all about the nostalgia trip, and I get it. We're talking about two games from the PS era here, remade for modern times with all the bells and whistles. But what really stands out is how well Vicarious Visions has done to update the gameplay without sacrificing any of its old-school charm.<br><br>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is all about that accessible-yet-tricky skating we know and love, and the levels are lovingly designed odes to the past. It's like going back in time, but with better graphics and a snappier soundtrack (because let's be real, who doesn't love some good ol' punk rock?). The challenges are still there, the gear is still rad, and online multiplayer is now an option - what more could you ask for?<br><br>Now, I know some of these other critics might say it's all just a rehashing of old ideas, but honestly, when something's this fun, who cares if it's new or not? The load times might be a bit wonky, and there aren't level goals for every skater, but those are pretty minor complaints. And let's give props to the developers - they've taken some risks and added in some new features that really make the game shine.<br><br>So yeah, Hippo Penny gives Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 a big ol' thumbs up (and maybe even a few flips of approval). It's a blast from the past that still feels fresh and current. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go grab my board and start practicing those sweet skate tricks... or not.",
