This remastered masterpiece has critics going wild, and for good reason. The game nails the original Tony Hawk experience, and I'm not just whistling Dixie.<br><br>IGN gave it a glowing review, praising its \"accessible yet tricky skating,\" lovingly designed levels that are like \"odes to the past,\" and music that's \"like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy.\" Yeah, it sounds like they're having a blast! Even cynical ol' me can't help but be won over by this retro revival.<br><br>GameSpot agrees, saying that the game \"nails\" its predecessor, with satisfying combos and no load times to get in the way. They also praise the addition of new characters and levels, making it an experience that's more than just a quick skate through the past.<br><br>Game Informer echoes these sentiments, calling it a \"terrific blast from the past.\" And when you've got critics like Gaming Age giving it a perfect score (100!), you know you've got something special on your hands.<br><br>But don't worry, I'm not going to get too carried away with all the praise. After all, even Worth Playing noted that the game is a bit short, and could have taken some more risks to really push the boundaries. But hey, when everything else works so nicely, who's complaining?<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Grab your board, don your best Thrasher-inspired outfit, and get ready to shred with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2!",
