    "comment": "Raccoo Venture is a charming platformer that, despite its nods to classic collectathon games, falls short in level design and innovation. The environmental puzzles are enjoyable but too brief, and the game suffers from uneven difficulty and frustrating mechanics. Despite its flaws, the game's beautiful design and music, along with its impressive performance on various systems, offer glimpses of its potential. While Raccoo Venture has its ups and downs, it's worth exploring for fans of the genre.",
