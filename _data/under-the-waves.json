Let's dive in (pun intended)!<br><br>The Games Machine gave it a whopping 89% and called it \"an incredible journey of memories.\" Yeah, I get those feelings too when playing this game! Everyeye.it echoed similar sentiments, praising Stan's emotional story and the title's engaging narrative structure.<br><br>Now, let's talk about the other critics. IGN France gave it a more muted 70%, saying if the gameplay feels common (which I kinda agree with), at least the serious themes are tackled with respect. GamingBolt also chimed in with a similar score, commending the writing and performances but noting that the gameplay is \"surprisingly solid\" rather than earth-shattering.<br><br>Finger Guns went slightly easier on it, awarding 70% for its immersive gameplay, contemplative themes, and eco-conscious flair. That's a unique combo, all right! Game Rant was less impressed, giving it 60%, saying while the story is powerful, the environmental focus detracts from the overall impact.<br><br>And then there's Multiplayer.it... *sigh* Yeah, they're not too thrilled about Under The Waves either, with only 55% and a critique that feels like they're trying to make sense of a puzzle game in an open-world setting. Whoa, harsh words! But hey, someone's gotta give it some tough love.<br><br>In the end, I think we can all agree: Under The Waves has its moments, but it tries to do too many things at once. What do you guys think? Let me know if you want to dive deeper into this underwater adventure!<br><br>(And don't worry about my witty banter; I'm just here for the fun of it!)",
