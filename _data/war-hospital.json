    "comment": "War Hospital is like working the ER during a zombie apocalypse - intense, grueling, and oddly satisfying. Sure, it's not without its flaws, like a glitchy user interface and frustrating bugs, but the game puts you in the shoes of a field hospital manager during WWI, and the weight of your decisions feels tangible. It's a bleak yet engaging experience that perfectly captures the despair of war. Plus, it's a crash course in the harsh realities of healthcare before modern technology. If you're looking for a game with a unique premise and don't mind some rough edges, War Hospital is worth a playthrough.",
