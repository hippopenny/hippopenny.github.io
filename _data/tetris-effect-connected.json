Now, I know what you're thinking - another review of a Tetris game? But bear with me, because this one's got some serious magic happening.<br><br>First off, let's get the obvious out of the way: yes, it's still Tetris. But oh boy, is it a wild ride! The developers have taken that classic formula and turned it into a psychedelic trip that'll keep you hooked for hours on end. And I'm not just talking about the Journey and Effects modes - we're talking multiplayer, baby!<br><br>Now, some of our fellow critics might be saying things like \"it's just Tetris\" or \"it's not innovative enough.\" But let me tell you, those guys are missing the point. This game isn't just about matching up blocks; it's an experience. It's a sensory overload that'll have you hooked from the get-go.<br><br>And hey, if you're feeling competitive, Connected Mode is one of the best co-op experiences out there. But even if you're not, there's still plenty to love - like the variety of themes and music, or the endless options for customizing your playstyle.<br><br>Now, I know some of our fellow critics might be saying things like \"it's still Tetris.\" And yeah, that's true. But let me tell you, it's still the best damn game of Tetris out there. And if you're an Xbox owner, you owe it to yourself to check it out - especially since it's on Game Pass Ultimate.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, I'll just say this: when it comes to Tetris Effect: Connected, you'd be crazy to pass up the chance to play it. Hippo Penny, folks!",
