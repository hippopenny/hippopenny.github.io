With a plethora of reviews from esteemed critics, I'll be sharing my own spin on this psychedelic puzzle game. Buckle up, folks, as we journey through the realm of shapes, music, and mesmerizing visuals!<br><br>First off, let's get those numbers out of the way. The critics are raving about Tetris Effect: Connected - 90s, 85s, 86s, and a perfect 100 from TheSixthAxis! Now that we've got our scorecard sorted, it's time to focus on the gameplay.<br><br>As I dove into the world of Tetris Effect: Connected, I couldn't help but feel like I was meditating (or cooking, or building models... you get the idea!) Amidst the mesmerizing visuals and pulsating music, my mind wandered off, and before I knew it, I'd sunk hours into the game! The Journey mode had me hooked; those Tetrominos were falling like confetti in a psychedelic dance party!<br><br>But wait, what about multiplayer? Ah, yes! Worth Playing's review highlights the addictive nature of this mode. I'm not ashamed to admit that I went down YouTube rabbit holes learning about t-spins and tips to improve my game. Even with my limited Tetris skills, I found myself replaying modes to beat my previous high score - a true testament to the game's staying power!<br><br>Now, let's poke fun at our esteemed critics (in a loving way, of course!). GameSpot's review mentions regrets about missing multiplayer in the original version... no worries, folks! TheXboxHub notes that it's still Tetris, but then again, what's wrong with that? Metro GameCentral praises the definitive version, and Cubed3 can't get enough of the psychedelic trip. Even Vandal's 86 might be the most realistic score - after all, who doesn't love a good game of Tetris?<br><br>In conclusion, Hippo Penny has given you the lowdown on Tetris Effect: Connected. It's a must-play for puzzle enthusiasts and newcomers alike! So, grab your favorite snack (I recommend something crunchy), put on your dancing shoes, and get ready to groove with those Tetrominos!<br><br>P.S. Don't forget to keep an eye out for my next review - who knows what other hidden gems I'll discover?",
