As a seasoned reviewer (wink), I know what makes a good game great – and this one's got it in spades.<br><br>First off, let's get the obligatory \"it's just Tetris\" out of the way. But trust me, Connected is more than just your average, everyday Tetris experience. The addition of multiplayer modes takes things to a whole new level (pun intended). Whether you're playing with friends or strangers, the competitive spirit will have you hooked.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – \"Is this game as good as the original?\" Well, let me tell you, fellow gamers, this review is all about the gameplay. And in that department, Connected delivers. With its stunning visuals and trippy soundtrack (I mean, who doesn't love a good Tetris tune?), this game will transport you to another dimension.<br><br>But enough about the big-name critics – what do I think? Well, for starters, I'm obsessed with the Journey mode's psychedelic vibes. It's like a puzzle-fueled meditation session! And don't even get me started on the multiplayer modes; it's like Tetris therapy (in a good way). My only complaint? The game's so addictive, I'll be stuck in this Tetromino loop forever!<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that's all about the fun factor, look no further. Tetris Effect: Connected is an absolute blast – and with its multiplayer capabilities, it's a must-have for anyone who loves a good puzzle challenge.<br><br>Stay groovy, gamers!",
