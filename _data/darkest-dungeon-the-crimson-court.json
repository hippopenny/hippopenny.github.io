Now, I know what you're thinking - another DLC review? But trust me, this one's a real treat.<br><br>As I delved deeper into the crimson-soaked world of Darkest Dungeon, I couldn't help but chuckle at some of the more... shall we say, \"enthusiastic\" reviews from our fellow critics. Ragequit.gr giving it a perfect 100? Please, that's like saying a Lovecraftian horror novel is just a nice cup of tea on a Sunday afternoon. GameSpew getting all poetic about tragedy and mortality? Yeah, I'm more concerned about my team's mortality rate than the meaning of life.<br><br>But hey, I digress. The Crimson Court is an excellent addition to Darkest Dungeon, adding fresh content and playability to an already excellent title. Games.cz summed it up nicely - \"dense, well-made addition that enriches an already excellent title with fresh content, playability and balanced difficulty.\" Yeah, I'll take my bloody pools of despair over a nice cup of tea any day.<br><br>Now, let's get to the nitty-gritty. The new character class is definitely worth the price alone. CD-Action called it \"fantastic,\" and I couldn't agree more. And what about that new area? Destructoid described it as \"a marathon-style new area that forces you to think differently about how to sustain your team over a long run.\" That's exactly what I want from DLC - a good challenge, not some watered-down nonsense.<br><br>Of course, there are some caveats. IGN noted that it might be more of a replay-friendly addition than an essential upgrade. Twinfinite was a bit more critical, saying it feels like an unfair beginner's trap. But hey, that's what makes Darkest Dungeon so darn good - the difficulty curve is always kept nice and steep.<br><br>In conclusion, The Crimson Court is an excellent DLC package for fans of Darkest Dungeon. It adds some much-needed variety to the game without watering down the core experience. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good blood-soaked monster or two? So grab your torches, friends, and get ready to face whatever horrors The Crimson Court has in store for you!",
