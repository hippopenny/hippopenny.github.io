As a seasonal grok, I'm all about bringing you the funkiest, most far-out takes on the games that make our whiskers twitch with excitement!<br><br>Now, let's get purr-fectly comfortable and dive into what these esteemed critics have to say. Impulsegamer gives it 92 points, calling Copycat \"atmospheric and poignant\" while also comparing its storytelling prowess to a Spanish guitarist (zing!). CGMagazine echoes this sentiment, awarding the game 80 points for its ability to tug at your heartstrings - tissues, anyone? Funnily enough, Finger Guns goes all in on the emotional resonance, saying that Copycat is \"both an enjoyable and reflective piece of art\" despite some minor missteps. <br><br>Try Hard Guides gives it a bit more of a reality check, knocking the game down to 70 for its \"unique cat-perspective narrative\" but also pointing out some weakness in the gameplay department. Checkpoint Gaming agrees on the strong narrative, scoring it 70 points, and even praises its bold storytelling moves! Hooked Gamers sees Copycat as an emotional ride worth taking at a gentle pace (perfect for those looking to unwind with a cat-titude adjustment), while multiplay.it... well, let's just say they couldn't quite bring themselves to write something nice about the game (score: 60).<br><br>All things considered, Copycat seems like it's got some purr-fectly amazing moments waiting to be discovered. Will you take the leap and pounce on this feline adventure?",
