    "comment": "Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader offers a vast and deep CRPG experience within the Games Workshop universe, capturing the harshness and moodiness of the 40K world while providing excellent writing and combat. However, the game suffers from technical issues and erratic game rules, impacting the overall experience. Despite these drawbacks, the title stands out as a surprisingly solid addition to the Warhammer 40K games collection, offering engaging exploration and character designs, but with the presence of bugs and some overly ambitious design choices.",
