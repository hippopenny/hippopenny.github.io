I'm excited to share my thoughts on AEW: Fight Forever, and I'll make sure it's a fun ride for all you young gamers out there.<br><br>First off, I want to mention that some critics have been pretty harsh on this game. IGN gave it a 60, saying it has \"unrealized potential.\" Ouch! Game Informer was a bit kinder, giving it a 63 and stating that it has a strong foundation but needs to catch up.<br><br>Now, let's talk about my experience with the game. I think AEW: Fight Forever is all about having fun, and it delivers on that front. The gameplay is arcade-style, which means you can pick up the controls quickly and start smashing your opponents around. It's like playing a wrestling video game from the 90s or early 2000s!<br><br>But what really stands out to me is how well the game captures the essence of AEW (All Elite Wrestling). The characters are all unique, with their own quirks and abilities. You can feel the pulse-raising energy of an AEW match as you play through the game.<br><br>Now, I know some critics have mentioned that the roster is limited, which is true. But hey, DLC could be just around the corner to help expand things out! And who knows? Maybe we'll see more content added in future updates.<br><br>What really gets me excited about AEW: Fight Forever is how accessible it is. You don't need to be a wrestling fan or an expert on the sport to enjoy this game. It's all about having fun and smashing your friends around!<br><br>Slant Magazine gave the game an 80, saying that it's \"accessible, breezy, and pulse-raising.\" I couldn't agree more! When everything clicks into place, you'll be having a blast playing through the career mode or just having some casual matches with friends.<br><br>Of course, not everyone is going to love AEW: Fight Forever. Some critics have mentioned that there are some hit detection issues (COGconnected) and basic creation suite options (SpazioGames). But hey, those things can always be fixed in updates!<br><br>In the end, I think AEW: Fight Forever is a solid choice for fans of wrestling games or just looking for something new to play. It's got that arcade vibe going on, which makes it super fun to play with friends.<br><br>What do you guys think? Are you excited to try out AEW: Fight Forever or have some favorite wrestling games already? Let me know in the comments!<br><br>That's it for now! Hippo Penny signing off!",
