Now, I know what you're thinking - another wrestling game? But hear me out, folks! This one's got potential (pun intended).<br><br>First off, the gameplay is solid. The controls are responsive, and the animations are smooth. You'll feel like a pro wrestler in no time, delivering kicks and punches with ease. And, let's be real, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned beatdown?<br><br>Now, I know some of my fellow critics might say that AEW: Fight Forever has its flaws. IGN gave it 60 points, saying the game has \"unrealized potential\" (ouch!). Game Informer scored it 63, stating that while the gameplay is strong, the rest of the package needs to catch up. And, SpazioGames? They gave it a measly 65, saying it's just not as polished as other wrestling games.<br><br>But fear not, dear readers! For COGconnected thinks AEW: Fight Forever is the real deal, giving it an impressive 86 points. Slant Magazine also loved it, praising the game's accessibility and faithfulness to the AEW brand. And, God is a Geek? They gave it 70, saying matches are a blast to play.<br><br>So, what's my take on AEW: Fight Forever? Well, I think it's a great starting point for a new wrestling game series. The gameplay is fun, and the career mode is a nice touch (more on that in a minute). Sure, there might be some bugs to iron out, but that's not uncommon with games of this type.<br><br>Now, about that career mode... I think it's one of the highlights of the game. You get to create your own wrestler, choose their moves, and work your way up the ranks. It's like a digital version of WWE 2K22, minus the ridiculous character customization (I mean, who needs 20 different hairstyles?!).<br><br>In conclusion, AEW: Fight Forever is an awesome wrestling game that's definitely worth checking out. Sure, it might not be perfect, but it's a solid foundation for what could become an amazing series. So, if you're an AEW fan or just looking for some fun wrestling action, I highly recommend giving this one a try!<br><br>Stay tuned for more wrestling goodness!",
