Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Is this a game-changer for wrestling fans?\" Well, let me tell you, it's not entirely a slam dunk (see what I did there?). But before we get into the nitty-gritty, let's take a look at what some of our friends in the gaming press have to say.<br><br>IGN gave it a 60, saying that AEW: Fight Forever has \"unrealized potential.\" Ouch! Game Informer scored it a 63, calling it a strong foundation for future growth. Slant Magazine was more optimistic, giving it an 80 and praising its accessibility and unique flair. Gaming Age handed out a 67, commending the game's chaotic fun and ease of play. SpazioGames came in with a 65, criticizing the lack of gameplay and content improvements. And finally, COGconnected gave it an impressive 86, calling it the best wrestling game since WWF No Mercy.<br><br>Now that we've got the critical consensus out of the way, let's get to what I think!<br><br>Honestly, AEW: Fight Forever is a mixed bag. On one hand, the game has some really great ideas - the bouncy animations are a lot of fun, and the character design is spot on. The action is fast-paced and easy to pick up, making it perfect for casual players or wrestling fans looking for a more arcade-style experience.<br><br>On the other hand, there are some serious issues holding this game back. The story mode is poorly written and lacks direction, making it feel like a chore to get through. And don't even get me started on the bugs - I lost count of how many times I had to restart a match because something went haywire.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, as someone who loves wrestling (and hates bugs), I think AEW: Fight Forever has some great bones but needs a lot more work. It's not a bad game by any stretch, but it doesn't quite live up to its potential.<br><br>If you're an AEW fan, you might still enjoy this release - just don't expect too much out of the single-player mode. And hey, at least it's a great alternative to those WWE games that always seem to be getting criticized.<br><br>So, there you have it! That's my take on AEW: Fight Forever. It's not the best game ever, but it's not the worst either. And hey, who knows - maybe that DLC will help turn things around?<br><br>Thanks for reading, and until next time, keep on gaming (and grumbling about bugs)!",
