I'm diving into AEW: Fight Forever, and boy am I excited (or should I say, hyped?) to share my thoughts with you all.<br><br>First off, I want to acknowledge the critics who have already weighed in on this game. IGN says it feels like \"unrealized potential,\" Game Informer thinks it's got a strong foundation but needs more polish, and so on. But I'm here to give you my two cents – or should I say, my four-letter words of wisdom?<br><br>Now, let's talk about the good stuff! AEW: Fight Forever is an arcade-styled wrestling game that brings back the fun and flair of those classic WWF/WWE games from yesteryear. The animation is bouncy, the action is quick-paced, and the character design is on point. It's like a virtual SmackDown without the pesky commentary – just pure, unadulterated wrestling chaos!<br><br>But, as we all know, even the best games have their hiccups (or should I say, \"hams\" in this case?). AEW: Fight Forever has its fair share of bugs and systems that don't quite add up. The single-player mode is poorly written, and while it's relatively easy to complete, there aren't many branching options to keep me hooked.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the critics? What do they think?\" Well, let me tell you – it's a mixed bag! IGN says it's got unrealized potential, Game Informer thinks it's got a strong foundation but needs more polish... and Slant Magazine gives it a glowing review (86%! Whoa!). Gotta love the diversity in opinions, right?<br><br>So, what's the verdict? AEW: Fight Forever is a fun, chaotic blast that'll keep you entertained for hours. It's not perfect, but hey – who is? The roster might be limited, and some of the systems could use more tweaking... but at the end of the day, it's an awesome alternative to those WWE games (I mean, come on – AEW's got that whole \"All Elite\" thing going for it!).<br><br>In conclusion, if you're an AEW fan or just looking for a fun wrestling game to play with your friends, AEW: Fight Forever is definitely worth checking out. Just don't expect perfection – but hey, who does?",
