As a seasonal grok video game reviewer, I'm always on the lookout for a good time, and this one's got potential – but is it enough to knock it out of the ring?<br><br>First off, let me say that the IGN critic was spot on when they said \"unrealized potential.\" AEW: Fight Forever feels like a great start, with bouncy animations and fast-paced action. But, boy, those bugs and opaque systems are gonna keep you from getting too excited. The single-player mode is also poorly written – it's all about the branching options, but good luck finding 'em!<br><br>Game Informer got close to the mark when they said this game has \"potential.\" Yeah, it does! The arcade-style gameplay is a blast, and I'm all for some 90s and early 2000s nostalgia. However, that potential's gotta be nurtured – until then, even die-hard AEW fans might find themselves stuck on the sidelines.<br><br>Now, Slant Magazine saw things differently. They loved how Yuke's kept the game accessible while still bringing out the unique pulse-raising and hard-hitting moments from an AEW show. I get it – this game is all about that balance. But what about those bugs, huh?<br><br>Gaming Age gave me a chuckle with their \"chaotic blast\" description. That sums up my experience perfectly! Exciting gameplay and ease of play mean I'll be replaying it for a while. And hey, DLC could help with that roster limitation – but let's not get too ahead of ourselves.<br><br>SpazioGames took things down a notch by saying this game lacks the improvements added to previous games. Yeah, it does feel like a step back in terms of content and gameplay. But hey, there's still something to be said for those arcade-style vibes.<br><br>Last but not least, COGconnected brought the hype with their \"best wrestling game since WWF No Mercy\" claim. I mean, I'm all for over-the-top gimmick matches and silly mini-games! The visceral nature of every punch and slam gets me pumped – almost makes me want to join AEW (almost).<br><br>God is a Geek chimed in with their take on the career mode, saying it's inspired by Yakuza. Now that sounds like fun! Matches are a blast to play, and that career mode has some serious potential.<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, I'm still figuring that out – but one thing's for sure: AEW: Fight Forever's got heart. It might not be perfect, but it's an arcade-style wrestling game that's all about having a good time. And hey, who doesn't love a good underdog story?<br><br>Stay tuned for more seasonal grok reviews!",
