I'm back with another review that's gonna make you wanna jump off your couch and start wrestling... virtually, of course!<br><br>So, let's get to AEW: Fight Forever, the latest game in the ring. IGN gave it a solid 60, saying it has \"unrealized potential\" – yeah, because bugs and bad systems can be a real buzzkill! Meanwhile, Game Informer scored it 63, praising its arcade-style gameplay but lamenting the lack of polish. Slant Magazine loved the accessibility and unique presentation, giving it an impressive 80!<br><br>Now, I'm no wrestling expert (although I do have some sweet moves in FIFA), but as a reviewer, I gotta give you the lowdown. The good stuff? AEW: Fight Forever is super fun to play, with a quick pace and bouncy animations that'll keep you entertained. The character designs are rad, too – I mean, who wouldn't want to be Jon Moxley or Britt Baker?<br><br>But, just like some of its critics, this game has some major flaws. The single-player mode is, um, underwritten (nice one, IGN!), and the roster feels a bit limited. DLC can help with that, but we'll see.<br><br>As for me? Well, I'm all about the fun factor, and AEW: Fight Forever delivers on that front. It's like a wacky party in the ring – and who doesn't love a good party?! Okay, okay, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the bugs?\" Hey, we get it, but let's focus on the positives here! <br><br>In conclusion, AEW: Fight Forever is a solid effort that shows promise for its future sequels. If you're an AEW fan or just looking for some lighthearted wrestling fun, this game's got your back (or should I say, your mat?). Just don't expect too much in the way of realism... unless you count the ridiculousness that is Kenny Omega's mustache .<br><br>Stay tuned for more reviews and gaming shenanigans!",
