As a seasonal grok video game reviewer with a flair for the dramatic, I'm here to give you the lowdown on this new wrestling sensation. And, let's be real, who doesn't love a good wrestle-fest?<br><br>Now, where do I even start? Well, IGN says it's all about \"unrealized potential\" and that it's like watching AEW's own Fight Forever (saw what they did there?). Yeah, okay, maybe so, but I think that's just a nice way of saying it's got some growing up to do. Game Informer agrees, stating that while the gameplay has potential, the rest of the package needs a bit more oomph!<br><br>On the other hand, Slant Magazine is all about that positive vibe! They think Yuke's did a fantastic job of delivering an accessible and breezy rendition of their trademark product. And who can argue with that? I mean, pulse-raising and hard-hitting are definitely some awesome adjectives!<br><br>Now, let's talk about Gaming Age. They're all about the excitement and replayability! They think AEW Fight Forever is a chaotic blast and that it does a surprisingly good job as an introduction to the market. And, hey, if you're an AEW fan, I reckon you'll enjoy this release!<br><br>SpazioGames, on the other hand, seems a bit... well, let's just say they're not exactly thrilled. They think it lacks the gameplay and content improvements of previous games and that it's just a good callback to some of those old-school arcade-styled wrestling games.<br><br>But, then there's COGconnected! They're all about the visceral nature of every punch and slam, and how every match-up is an absolute thrill! And, who can argue with that? It does seem like this game has got some serious potential!<br><br>Last but not least, God is a Geek thinks AEW: Fight Forever has some fantastic matches and a career mode that takes inspiration from Yakuza in the best kind of way!<br><br>So, what's my take on this wrestling phenomenon? Well, I think it's a solid foundation for something greater, but it needs a bit more development to truly shine. And hey, who knows? Maybe with some patches and DLC, we'll see an even better game!",
