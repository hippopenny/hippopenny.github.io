As someone who's always up for a good smackdown (pun intended), I'm excited to dive into the world of All Elite Wrestling and see if this game delivers.<br><br>First off, let me just say that AEW: Fight Forever has some major potential. The gameplay is solid, with a great balance between arcade-style fun and more realistic wrestling moves. And hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned body slam? <br><br>But, as my fellow critics have pointed out (hello, IGN!), the game isn't without its flaws. I mean, we're talking bugs, folks! Like, major ones that can really hamper your experience. And don't even get me started on the single-player mode - it's like they took all the excitement and energy of an actual wrestling match and replaced it with... *yawn* ...more yapping.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Hippo Penny, why are you being so harsh?\" Well, let me tell you, folks, as a critic (ahem), it's my job to call out the good, the bad, and the ugly. And trust me when I say that AEW: Fight Forever has its share of both.<br><br>But hey, that doesn't mean it's all bad news! The game does have some real charm, especially when you're playing with friends. There's something special about getting together with your squad and having a virtual wrestling party (complete with silly mini-games and over-the-top gimmick matches - more on those in a bit!).<br><br>And let's not forget the roster - while it may be limited, there are still some amazing wrestlers to play as and with. Plus, who knows? Maybe DLC will bring even more characters and game modes to the table.<br><br>So, all things considered, AEW: Fight Forever is a solid effort from Yuke's (the same folks behind WWE 2K). Sure, it's not perfect, but hey, that's what sequels are for, right?<br><br>In conclusion, if you're an AEW fan looking for a fun, arcade-style wrestling experience with your friends, then AEW: Fight Forever might just be the ticket. Just don't expect too much from the single-player mode... and try to overlook those pesky bugs!",
