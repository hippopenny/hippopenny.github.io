And honestly, it's a bit like me - a little rough around the edges, but with a ton of potential. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned wrestle-fest?<br><br>But let's get real, folks. This game is not without its flaws. IGN called it \"unrealized potential,\" and I gotta say, that feels about right. The animations are bouncy (get it?), the pace of the action is quick, and character design is on point... but then you've got bugs and systems that are just plain opaque. It's like trying to navigate a wrestling match blindfolded while simultaneously playing \"spot the invisible bug.\" Not exactly the most thrilling experience.<br><br>Game Informer was a bit more optimistic, saying it has potential (yawn), but still needs to catch up with the rest of the package. I mean, can you blame them? AEW: Fight Forever is like the kid who shows up to prom looking all sharp and handsome, but then forgets to bring his date (the game's actual good ideas).<br><br>Slant Magazine, on the other hand, was all about that \"accessible\" and \"breezy\" vibe. And I get it - sometimes you just wanna throw some virtual punches and have a blast with your buds. But let's not forget, folks, this is an AEW game we're talking about. We want depth, complexity, and maybe even a little bit of storyline drama (you know, like when Cody Rhodes turns heel... again).<br><br>Gaming Age had the best quote, saying it's \"a really chaotic blast.\" And honestly, that's what drew me in - the sheer energy and unpredictability of those matches. It's like watching an AEW PPV, minus the occasional botched spot (looking at you, Adam Page).<br><br>SpazioGames was a bit more downbeat, saying it lacks content improvements from previous games. Well, duh. This is an arcade-style wrestling game, not a simulation!<br><br>But COGconnected took the cake with their glowing review, calling it the \"best wrestling game since WWF No Mercy.\" I mean, that's some high praise right there! And honestly, playing AEW: Fight Forever feels like stepping into the ring with a top-notch opponent - you gotta bring your A-game to come out on top.<br><br>God is a Geek summed it up nicely, saying matches are \"a ton of fun to play\" and the career mode takes inspiration from Yakuza in a good way. Yeah, that sounds about right.<br><br>So what's the verdict? AEW: Fight Forever is a solid effort with some great moments, but it's not without its growing pains (and bugs). If you're an AEW fan, you might enjoy this release, even if it doesn't quite live up to the hype. But hey, at least it tries!",
