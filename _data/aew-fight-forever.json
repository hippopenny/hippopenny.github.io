This time, I'm tackling AEW: Fight Forever, a wrestling game that's got everyone in the gaming community talking.<br><br>Let me tell you, this game is like trying to navigate a WWE storyline - it's all over the place! You've got some great ideas, some not-so-great execution, and a whole lot of potential waiting to be unleashed. IGN gave it a score of 60, saying it's a game that \"feels like a very good start\" but is ultimately hampered by bugs and poorly designed systems. I mean, who hasn't been there, right?<br><br>Game Informer scored it slightly higher at 63, calling it a \"strong foundation\" that needs to be built upon. And honestly, that's the best way to describe AEW: Fight Forever - it's got some great building blocks, but they need to be polished and refined.<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, you've got Slant Magazine giving it an 80, saying Yuke's has managed to create an \"accessible\" and \"breezy\" game that captures the essence of AEW. And I have to agree - when things are clicking, this game is a blast! The gameplay is fun, the action is fast-paced, and you can't help but feel like you're right there in the ring with the likes of Kenny Omega and Jon Moxley.<br><br>Gaming Age scored it 67, saying it's \"chaotic\" and \"exciting\" - and that's exactly what I want from a wrestling game! The roster might be limited, and the DLC situation is still up in the air, but overall, AEW: Fight Forever is a great first effort. And let me tell you, for an AEW fan like myself, it's a dream come true to have a game that actually feels like a love letter to the wrestling promotion.<br><br>But don't just take my word (or anyone else's) for it - SpazioGames gave it a 65, saying it lacks some of the improvements and additions made in previous games. And COGconnected scored it an impressive 86, calling it \"the best wrestling game since WWF No Mercy.\" I mean, that's high praise indeed!<br><br>And finally, God is a Geek gave it a solid 70, saying the matches are a ton of fun to play and the career mode is inspired by Yakuza (which, let's be real, sounds like an amazing concept).<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, I think AEW: Fight Forever is a game that's got some great potential, but needs a little more work to get it just right. But hey, when things are clicking, this game is a real showstopper - so here's hoping they keep working on those bugs and polishing up the rough edges.<br><br>That's all for now, folks! Hippo Penny signing off - see you in the next review!",
