Get ready for some sassy reviews and a healthy dose of snarky humor!<br><br>As I dive into AEW: Fight Forever, I'm excited to see what this new wrestling game has in store. But first, let's take a peek at what the critics have been saying:<br><br>* IGN gave it a 60, citing \"unrealized potential\" and complaining about bugs and opaque systems.<br>* Game Informer scored it a 63, praising the arcade-style gameplay but bemoaning the lack of polish elsewhere.<br>* Slant Magazine went all in with an 80, celebrating the game's accessibility and unique charm.<br>* Gaming Age gave it a 67, enjoying the chaotic gameplay and ease of play, while lamenting the limited roster and potential for DLC.<br>* SpazioGames panned it at 65, criticizing its lack of innovation and stagnation compared to previous games.<br>* COGconnected awarded it an impressive 86, declaring it the best wrestling game in years due to its thrilling matches and pick-up-and-play charm.<br>* God is a Geek scored it a 70, praising the fun match-ups and career mode inspired by Yakuza.<br><br>So, what's my take on AEW: Fight Forever? Well, I'll get right down to business: this game is a wild ride! It's like a high-energy party with your friends, minus the noise complaints from the neighbors. The combat is fast-paced and exciting, with some genuinely satisfying moves and combos.<br><br>But, as many of the critics pointed out, there are some hiccups along the way. Bugs can be frustrating (and yes, I experienced them myself), and the systems in place for character creation and match selection are occasionally confusing. Still, when it clicks â€“ oh boy, does it ever! You'll find yourself having a blast with your favorite wrestlers or even creating your own.<br><br>In conclusion, AEW: Fight Forever is a fun, if imperfect, addition to the wrestling game scene. While it may not be perfect, I'm all for giving it another match (pun intended). So, if you're looking for some friendly competition and high-flying hijinks, strap yourself in and join the fight!",
