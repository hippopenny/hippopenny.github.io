I've taken a look at what some other critics have said, and while they're all generally positive, there are some notable differences.<br><br>IGN seems to think that the game has unrealized potential - and boy, do I agree! With bugs galore and systems that are either opaque or downright useless, it's like trying to wrestle a greased pig (or in this case, a bug-filled wrestling match). But hey, at least they acknowledge the good stuff!<br><br>Game Informer is also on the same wavelength - they love the arcade-style gameplay, but think the rest of the package needs some work. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned beat-em-up? And with AEW: Fight Forever, you can channel your inner 90s wrestling fan (or early 2000s, for that matter).<br><br>Slant Magazine has a different take - they think Yuke's has done an awesome job of delivering an accessible and breezy rendition of their trademark product. I mean, if you're looking for a fun, no-frills wrestling game, this might be the way to go! <br><br>Gaming Age is all about that chaotic gameplay - it's like a wild ride, minus the bugs (mostly). They think the limited roster could be a problem, but DLC might just fix that. I'm down for some extra content!<br><br>SpazioGames, on the other hand, thinks AEW: Fight Forever lacks improvements made in previous games by the same developers. You know what they say - you can't have your cake and eat it too (or in this case, not having enough cake).<br><br>And finally, COGconnected is singing the praises of AEW: Fight Forever - they think it's the best wrestling game since WWF No Mercy! That's some high praise, right there. And while there are some issues with hit detection and community uploads, that doesn't take away from the visceral fun of every physical match-up.<br><br>As for me? I'm just here to bring a bit of humor to the table (or in this case, the ring). So, if you're looking for a wrestling game that's got some bite but not too much bite (wink), then AEW: Fight Forever might be the ticket!<br><br>Stay tuned for more fun and games (and maybe a few more wrestling puns)!",
