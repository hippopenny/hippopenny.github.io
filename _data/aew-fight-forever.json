When I heard about AEW: Fight Forever, I was stoked to see a new game that brings the excitement of professional wrestling to the digital arena. And, boy, does it deliver! Well, mostly.<br><br>I've read through the reviews from my fellow critics (hello, IGN, Game Informer, Slant Magazine, Gaming Age, SpazioGames, and COGconnected!), and while I agree with some of their points, I think we can all agree that this game has some unrealized potential. But hey, that's what sequels are for, right?<br><br>Now, let's get to the good stuff! The gameplay in AEW: Fight Forever is top-notch. It's all about that arcade-style wrestling goodness we all know and love. And, boy, does it feel like a blast! I mean, who wouldn't want to play as their favorite AEW stars, like Kenny Omega or Jon Moxley? It's like having your own wrestling universe right in the palm of your hand!<br><br>But, let's not sugarcoat things – this game ain't perfect. There are some serious bugs and opaque systems that can make it tough to navigate. I mean, I got stuck on a match because the opponent just wouldn't stay down! Talk about frustrating!<br><br>And don't even get me started on the single-player mode. It's like they took all the excitement of an AEW show and watered it down. I mean, what happened to the branching options? Did they get lost in the weeds, just like my wrestling career did?<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about the roster?\" Well, let me tell you – it's a mixed bag! You've got your top stars, but then you've also got some newer faces that are still finding their footing. And don't even get me started on the DLC rumors – it's like they're trying to make us fans pay for what should be included in the base game!<br><br>All joking aside, AEW: Fight Forever does have its moments of pure wrestling magic. When everything clicks, and you're flying high with your favorite wrestlers, it's hard not to get caught up in the excitement.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, I think this game is a solid 7 out of 10. It's got some great bones, but it needs some work to really make it shine. And hey, that's what sequels are for, right?<br><br>But enough about me – let's hear from you, folks! What do you think about AEW: Fight Forever? Do you agree with my assessment, or do you think I'm just being a grumpy old wrestling fan? Let me know in the comments below!<br><br>And remember, Hippo Penny - Always Keep it Real and Wrestling-tastic!",
