As a self-proclaimed wrestling game enthusiast (read: obsessed), I was eager to dive in and see what this new title had to offer. And, oh boy, it's got some real potential!<br><br>First off, let me just say that Yuke's has done an excellent job of capturing the energy and essence of All Elite Wrestling. The animations are bouncy, the action is fast-paced, and the character designs are fun and effective. It's like stepping into a match from the squared circle itself! <br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But [Your Name], what about all those other critics? What do they have to say?\" Well, let me tell you, some of these folks have got some serious beef with Fight Forever. IGN called it out for feeling like a \"very good start\" that's ultimately hampered by bugs and useless systems. Game Informer said it's got potential, but the rest of the package needs to catch up. And on the flip side, COGconnected is all about hailing it as the best wrestling game in 20 years!<br><br>As for me? Well, I think Fight Forever is a solid foundation for a sequel (or three). The gameplay has some real zing, and when it's firing on all cylinders, it's absolute chaos...in the best way possible! <br><br>Of course, there are some nits to pick. The roster could be beefed up (pun intended), and some folks might find the single-player mode a bit lacking. But hey, for an arcade-styled wrestling game, I'm not complaining! <br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, if you're an AEW fan or just looking for a fun wrestling game to play with friends, Fight Forever is definitely worth a spin (or three). Just don't expect it to be perfect...yet!<br><br>That's it for now, folks! Keep on gaming, and remember: Hippo Penny knows what's up!",
