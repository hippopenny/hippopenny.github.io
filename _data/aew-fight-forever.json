It's your boy Grok, back with another review that's gonna make you wanna jump into the ring and start slapping some sense into these wrestling games!<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - AEW: Fight Forever, huh? Well, let me tell you, this game is like a fine-tuned wrestling move - it's got some serious potential, but also some major flaws. But hey, that's what makes life interesting, right?<br><br>So, let's get to the good stuff first. The gameplay in AEW: Fight Forever is solid gold, baby! It's fast-paced, it's fun, and it's full of those crazy wrestling moves you love to see (and occasionally pull off yourself, if you're like me). And hey, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned arcade-style wrestling game? It's like stepping back into the '90s, when wrestling was all about high-flying action and trash-talking rivalries.<br><br>But then there are the bugs. Ah, man, those pesky little critters just won't quit! They're like a swarm of pesky insects buzzing around your head, making it hard to focus on what's important - beating the heck out of your opponent.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the story mode. Now, I know some folks might say, \"Hey, Grok, what about all those branching options?\" Well, let me tell you, they're a nice idea, but when the writing is as weak as a wrestler's promissory note, it's hard to care.<br><br>But hey, at least the graphics are nice. The character designs are snazzy, and the animations are smooth (except for those pesky bugs, of course). And let me tell you, the music - oh man, the music is like a fist-pumping anthem just begging to be played during your next wrestling match.<br><br>Now, I know some folks might say, \"Grok, what about all those other critics?\" Well, let me tell you, they're all wrong (or right, depending on how you look at it). IGN thinks the game's got unrealized potential. Game Informer says it needs to catch up with its own potential. Slant Magazine praises its accessibility and fun factor. Gaming Age loves its chaos and replayability. SpazioGames thinks it's just okay. And COGconnected - well, they think it's the best wrestling game in 20 years! (So, yeah, I'm basically a critic too... but with more humor and fewer bugs).<br><br>Anyway, that's my two cents on AEW: Fight Forever. It's like a mixed bag of wrestling moves - some hit, some don't. But hey, that's what makes it so fun to play around with!<br><br>So, if you're an AEW fan looking for something new and different, then AEW: Fight Forever might just be the game for you. Just don't forget to patch those bugs, or else your match might not go off without a hitch!",
