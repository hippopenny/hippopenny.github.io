Let's get this review party started!<br><br>AEW: Fight Forever is like the wrestling equivalent of a hip-hop mashup - it's got some dope moves, but it's still finding its rhythm. As a seasonal grok (that's me!), I'm all about that game-play life, and AEW: Fight Forever has some serious potential to knock out your opponents. Or, you know, just hang with your pals and have a blast.<br><br>Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of what these critics are saying (cough, cough). IGN is like the grumpy old uncle who says, \"Unrealized potential?\" Yeah, yeah, we get it - there's room for improvement. Game Informer's all about that \"strong foundation,\" though! They're stoked to have a more arcade-styled wrestling game, and I am too (I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned beat-down?). Slant Magazine is like the cool cat who says, \"Pulse-raising\" and \"hard-hitting\"? Yeah, that's me all over - minus the pulse-raising part (I'm more of a steady-state kind of guy). Gaming Age is all about that \"chaotic blast,\" though! They're excited to see what the future holds for this series. SpazioGames is like the grumpiest critic on the block, saying it's just a good ol' fashioned callback to the past - no frills, no thrills. COGconnected is all about that \"visceral nature\" and \"thrill\"? Yeah, I'm there, dude! God is a Geek just wants to have fun with their friends, which is, like, totally my vibe too (minus the \"God\" part).<br><br>So, what's the takeaway? AEW: Fight Forever's got some great moves, but it's still finding its footing. It's not perfect, but hey - who is? It's got potential, and I'm stoked to see where this series goes from here!",
