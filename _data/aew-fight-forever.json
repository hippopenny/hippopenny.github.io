Now, I know what you're thinking - what's a groovy game reviewer like me doing writing about a wrestling game? Well, let me tell you, I'm not just any ol' critic, I'm a funky fresh voice in the gaming world, here to bring the heat and give you the lowdown on this AEW-filled adventure.<br><br>So, what's the scoop on Fight Forever? It seems like a solid effort from Yuke's, bringing some much-needed arcade-style wrestling flair back into our lives. Now, I'm not going to lie - it's not perfect. There are some pesky bugs and opaque systems that can get in the way of your smackdown-filled fun. But hey, who doesn't love a good challenge?<br><br>Let's start with the positives - the gameplay is where Fight Forever really shines. It's fast-paced, fun, and full of flair. The animations are bouncy (see what I did there?), and the character designs are on point. You'll be hooked from the get-go, just like I was.<br><br>But, as my homies at IGN pointed out, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The single-player mode is a bit of a letdown - poorly written and lacking direction (I mean, what's up with those branching options, am I right?). And don't even get me started on the roster limitations. It's like they took a cue from my favorite wrestling move - the \"limited edition\" low blow.<br><br>Now, where do our fellow critics fit into all this? Well, it seems like Game Informer is all about that potential - yeah, Fight Forever has got some unrealized potential lying around. Slant Magazine gives it props for being accessible and fun, while Gaming Age thinks it's a chaotic blast (I'm with them on that one). And then there's SpazioGames, who thinks it's just a good callback to old-school arcade wrestling games, but lacking in the modern department.<br><br>But hey, I'm not here to nitpick - COGconnected agrees with me that Fight Forever is the best wrestling game since WWF No Mercy. That's right, folks, they're saying it's a real contender (see what I did there again?).<br><br>In conclusion, AEW: Fight Forever is a wild ride filled with fun and potential. Sure, it's not perfect, but who doesn't love a good underdog story? It's like the wrestling version of Rocky IV - you know, where Apollo Creed says, \"Yo, Adrian!\" (Okay, I'll stop now).<br><br>So, if you're an AEW fan or just looking for some good ol' fashioned wrestling action, Fight Forever is the game for you. Just don't expect it to be a five-star affair from the get-go - but hey, that's what makes life interesting, right?",
