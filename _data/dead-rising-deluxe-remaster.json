It's your buddy, Groggy McFunster - the grooviest video game commentator out there!<br><br>Dead Rising Deluxe Remastered is like a hippie aunt at a family reunion - it's old, but still brings forth some groovy vibes. Who wouldn't want to slice and dice zombies in a shopping mall? Right, everyone! This remastered version keeps the core game intact while adding oodles of eye-candy (thank you, graphical overhaul!) and quality-of-life improvements.<br><br>I love how Impulsegamer (Score:100) says it's fantastic for those who can adapt to the original game's age. Yeah, that's hippie speak for \"it shows its age,\" but with a positive spin, man! Gosh, if only my mom could get with this vibe...<br><br>Now, some reviewers are more chill than others. Impulse Gamer's Score: 100; GamingBolt's score is an impressive 90 - nice and toasty! LevelUp gives it a sizzling 85; Power Unlimited thinks it's awesome (no surprise there) with a Score:83; GameSpew and Gamers Heroes give it a solid 80, all agreeing the visuals and QOL changes make it even better. However, Gameblog.fr... well, they're like my hippie uncle - super critical and grumpy (Score:60). They think the game has aged badly and didn't really get a deep makeover.<br><br>So, if you're looking to relive some zombie-slaying fun from back in the day or experience it for the first time, Dead Rising Deluxe Remastered (try saying that with your eyes shut) is the way to go! Just remember, folks - even though it's an oldie but a goodie, you might need to adapt to its age. And hey, who knows? You might just find some far-out moments in this rad remaster!<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my own review article. Wish me good vibes, and let the gaming magic begin!",
