As I settle in for a playthrough, I can't help but wonder what all the fuss is about.<br><br>Let me tell you, COGconnected was having a blast with this one! They praised the sound design, which I'm sure is music to many gamers' ears (pun intended). But what really stood out was how elegantly the game's systems interacted. It's like a symphony of war, if you will (okay, I'll stop).<br><br>RPG Fan also had some great things to say about Symphony of War. They noted that it draws from classic heavyweights in the genre but still manages to stand on its own two feet. With plenty to uncover and do throughout a playthrough, this game is an adventure fans of tactical RPGs won't want to miss.<br><br>CD-Action was another critic who fell head over heels for Symphony of War. They loved how addictive it was, even with some minor flaws like poor enemy AI. I mean, 16 hours spent playing in one sitting? That's dedication!<br><br>The Games Machine also gave this game a thumbs up, praising its strong and compelling turn-based strategy mechanics. And PC Gamer called it a contender for the best strategy RPG of the year – high praise indeed!<br><br>Of course, not everyone was completely sold on Symphony of War. Movies Games and Tech thought the narrative felt rushed and uninteresting, but still enjoyed the squad-based gameplay and management mechanics.<br><br>Siliconera had a similar experience, appreciating the game's quirks and finding joy in tweaking squad builds and fiddling with systems.<br><br>So what's my take on this tactical RPG? Well, I think it's safe to say that Symphony of War is a unique gem that will appeal to fans of the genre. With its mix of simplicity and depth, there's definitely something here for everyone – even if it isn't perfect. And hey, who doesn't love a good underdog story?<br><br>In short, Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga is a delightful surprise that will keep you hooked from start to finish. Give it a try, and see what all the fuss is about!",
