This game is like a delicious parfait of detective work, drama, and maybe a few too many mixed metaphors (you know who you are, developers!). <br><br>But let's get down to business. Our first stop is \"Noisy Pixel,\" who gave it a well-deserved 100 out of 100. Now, I'm not saying the others should've spent more time crafting their meticulously crafted and fleshed-out narratives, but... actually, that would be awesome!<br><br>Next up is \"Multiplayer.it\" with a very \"Quotation forthcoming.\" kind of statement. You know what they say: when life gives you lemons, make lemonade; but when life gives you a review, just shrug and say, \"Quotation forthcoming!\"<br><br>Coming in at a respectable 85 points is our boy \"Vandal\", who also chose the very same response (see what I did there?). Don't worry, guys, we won't let this dampen our spirits. After all, as they say in the critic-verse: when life gives you Quotas for Quotation forthcoming...<br><br>Of course, no review round table would be complete without our beloved \"Pocket Tactics\" crew! With a 80/100 score, they brought their full arsenal of enthusiasm and gave Emio - The Smiling Man both kudos for its twisting narrative and... um (just going to say it) gentle loving-kindness towards the game itself. Y'know what I mean!<br><br>Time's up for \"Destructoid\" at 75 points - but fear not, readers! This crew will definitely stick in your mind with their incredible narrative which left them feeling both immersed AND (get this!) impactful to a point where they almost had an existential crisis about the whole experience of being human and all that jazz.<br><br>And so finally, we have \"Player 2\" at an honest score of 67. Don't worry, guys, your lack of improvement is a joke - I mean, not literally! Seriously though, your dark mystery might've been held back from greatness (that just means keep trying), but it's all fun and games until... you get to that super-impactful (you know the one) part in the narrative!<br><br>Last but definitely not least, we have \"GRYOnline.pl\" - now I know what they're thinking: \"Why are you getting under my skin?!\" (see what I did there?). At a modest 50/100 points - who knows why they say that this visual novel has solid detective work throughout? Was it maybe to balance out the whole lack of crime thing or did their love for drama storylines just overshadow everything? Ah, mystery of the century!<br><br>So there you have it, folks: Hippo Penny's epic review extravaganza for Emio - The Smiling Man!",
