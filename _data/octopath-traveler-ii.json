With a slew of glowing reviews from critics, I'm expecting big things from this follow-up. Let's see how it stacks up!<br><br>First off, I want to acknowledge the love letter to Square Enix's golden years that Game Revolution so aptly described. The game indeed feels like a greatest hits collection of mechanics from across various franchises. It's like they took all the best parts from their own games (think Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, and Xenogears) and mashed them together in a delightful JRPG cocktail.<br><br>Combat, as Vandal so eloquently put it, is no longer the stiffest aspect of the game. Instead, it's been spiced up with some much-needed additions that make battles more engaging and strategic. And let me tell you, when those Latent Abilities kick in, you'll be having a blast (pun intended)!<br><br>Storywise, Octopath Traveler II doesn't break new ground (see: Game Informer's review), but it builds upon the foundation of the original by improving character development, pacing, and overall narrative. It's a delightful experience from start to finish, as Nintendo Life so sweetly put it.<br><br>Now, I know some critics might say that Octopath Traveler II doesn't reinvent the wheel, but honestly, who needs to when you're this good? The game's confidence in its storytelling and gameplay is palpable, making it a sterling achievement (Game Informer again) in the JRPG realm.<br><br>In conclusion, Octopath Traveler II is a must-play for any RPG fan looking for an excellent experience. With gorgeous visuals, an incredible soundtrack, and strategic combat, this sequel is a triumphant follow-up that will leave you wanting more (see: Nintendo Life's review). So grab your party hats and get ready to travel the octopath!<br><br>Time to wrap up this groovy review with some final thoughts - Octopath Traveler II is a love letter to JRPGs, and I'm all for it!",
