Building upon the foundations of the original, they've conjured up a sequel that improves upon nearly every aspect. Combat mechanics? Check! Path Actions? You bet! Freeform progress? Yeah, got it!<br><br>But what about those pesky critics? Ah, yes! I dug into their reviews to see how they reacted to this JRPG masterpiece. GameSpot praised the game's confidence in its storytelling and design, saying it's a \"delight from start to finish.\" Game Informer echoed similar sentiments, calling it a \"sterling achievement\" that improves upon the original in nearly every way.<br><br>Meanwhile, Vandal chimed in with some good ol' fashioned JRPG nostalgia, saying this sequel doesn't reinvent the wheel but still manages to deliver one of the best JRPGs in recent years. Nintendo Life went full-on fanboy mode (like yours truly!) and declared Octopath Traveler II a \"triumphant\" follow-up that showcases Team Asano's mastery of their craft.<br><br>GamingTrend was similarly blown away, claiming it surpasses the original in every way – and I'm inclined to agree! The music is still top-notch, the combat has some much-needed spice, and the story... well, let's just say it's a real page-turner (or screen-swiper, if you will).<br><br>Of course, not everyone was singing the same tune. SpazioGames did point out some quality-of-life improvements and tweaks that make Octopath Traveler II a superior product to its predecessor. Game Revolution also chimed in with some praise for the game's greatest-hits collection of mechanics from across Square Enix's franchises.<br><br>In conclusion, Octopath Traveler II is a retro-style RPG that'll have you dancing the hippie hop (or at least tapping your toes) with joy! It's a must-play for any fan of JRPGs, and if you're new to the series... well, where have you been?! Join me in this groovy adventure, and let's get our Octopath on!<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go polish my critic's glasses – they've seen better days.",
