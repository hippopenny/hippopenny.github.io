Now, I know what you're thinking - why is this review different from the others? Well, let me tell you, it's because I'm a hip hop loving, game playing, reviewer extraordinaire! Okay, maybe not that last part, but I do have a lot of fun writing these reviews.<br><br>So, Octopath Traveler II has been getting some great reviews from other critics. GameSpot gives it an 80, saying it builds upon the foundations of the original by improving on what worked and adding new ideas. Game Informer agrees, giving it an 85, stating that it's a sterling achievement that improves on the original in nearly every way.<br><br>Now, I'm not going to lie, some of these reviews are quite similar. Vandal and Nintendo Life both give it an 85, saying it doesn't reinvent the wheel but improves upon everything. Game Revolution gives it a 90, calling it another love letter to Square Enix's golden years. SpazioGames gives it an 88, praising its writing, visuals, and combat system.<br><br>GamingTrend gives it the highest praise of all, a 90, saying that it surpasses the original in every way. So, what does this mean for me? Well, I have to bring my A-game if I want to compete with these reviews!<br><br>Now, onto the review! Octopath Traveler II is an excellent sequel that builds upon the foundations of the original. The combat system is still turn-based but with some new additions like a day/night cycle and Latent Abilities. These abilities are triggered by certain conditions or enemies, which adds a nice layer of strategy to the battles.<br><br>The story is also well-written, with each character having their own unique personalities and motivations. The pacing is good, with each chapter feeling like a self-contained story while still contributing to the overall narrative.<br><br>One thing that stands out about Octopath Traveler II is its visuals. The game has a beautiful art style, with hand-drawn characters and environments. The soundtrack is also amazing, with catchy tunes that really add to the game's atmosphere.<br><br>Overall, I think Octopath Traveler II is a great sequel that improves upon the original in many ways. It's a must-play for fans of JRPGs and anyone looking for a great RPG experience.<br><br>So, what do you guys think? Have you played Octopath Traveler II? What did you think of it? Let me know in the comments!<br><br>That's it for my review of Octopath Traveler II! I hope you enjoyed it and that it helps you decide whether or not to play the game. Until next time, stay hip hop and keep on gaming!",
