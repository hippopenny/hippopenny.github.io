I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned basketball simulation, am I right?<br><br>First off, IGN France is giving it a solid 90% saying it remains \"the undisputed master of sports simulation.\" I mean, that's some serious flattery! They're all about the court life, getting those VCs (Virtual Currency) and complaining about the whole shebang. Okay, got it! NBA 2K25's got the goods!<br><br>Next up, But Why Tho? is giving it an 85%, mentioning radical gameplay improvements and the most authentic NBA experience to date. It seems they're all for that #NBA2K25Life! Who wouldn't want more realism on their virtual hardwood?<br><br>Twinfinite chimes in with an 80% saying, \"this makes it more of an obvious choice compared to last year's offering.\" Ah, the eternal struggle – do you go with the old or is the new better? It seems NBA 2K25 is the new cool!<br><br>Now, Hobby Consolas brings it down a notch with a 79%, mentioning those pesky microtransactions and presentation issues. Hmm, sounds like someone's got some gripes!<br><br>GAMES.CH also gives it a 79% saying it's finally back on track after the last few releases... as long as you're not too bothered by those microtransactions! Like, what's the deal with all the money?<br><br>Gameliner takes a stand with a 70%, mentioning an impressive performance but suffering from annual releases leaving little room for innovation. Who knew that being too consistent could be a bad thing? <br><br>Last but definitely not least, IGN Spain agrees with a 70% saying it's probably the best instalment in recent years off the court... *sigh* online woes aside.<br><br>So, what does Hippo Penny know? NBA 2K25's got some great things going on – authentic gameplay, improved systems, and some fresh faces. The only real question is: will those microtransactions bring the whole game down like a swan-diving, awkward dance move?<br><br>What do you think, folks? Which crit-buddy resonated with your NBA 2K25 experience? Share your thoughts!",
