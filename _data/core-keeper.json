They're like a bunch of excited hippos at a water park! The Games Machine is completely \"glued to the screen\" with Core Keeper, and who can blame them? The game's engaging and exciting, with a perfect balance of development and creativity.<br><br>But wait, not everyone's as hyped up! GameStar thinks it's no replacement for Terraria or Minecraft. Okay, got it, GameStar. But that doesn't mean it's bad – quite the opposite, in fact. It's just \"in its current state\" (whatever that means).<br><br>And then there's Destructoid, my friend, who's not convinced Core Keeper can match the quality and scope of its best-in-class inspirations. Hmm, I'm with you on this one, Destructoid! But hey, it's already worth a look in Early Access, so let's keep an eye out for its potential.<br><br>Now, onto some of my personal favorite reviews. Shacknews calls Core Keeper \"the kind of game you can slowly chip away at over several evenings,\" and I'm all about that chill vibe!<br><br>GamingBolt thinks it offers strong competition to Terraria and Valheim, and honestly, who wouldn't want a bit more competition in the sandbox-mining game space?<br><br>And last but not least, we have Hardcore Gamer going full-blown enthusiastic on Core Keeper's variety of play options. They're talking \"constantly pet-friendly,\" \" minecart rail lines,\" and even an underground sea! I'm here for all that!<br><br>Alright, what do you think, gamers? Do these opinions resonate with you? Should we get pumped up about Core Keeper's greatness or keep a healthy dose of skepticism?<br><br>(Just remember, it's just a game – don't have a heart attack if someone disagrees with your rating!)",
