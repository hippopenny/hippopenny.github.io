    "comment": "Hippo Penny - It's your groovy reviewer here, back with another rad review!<br><br>Cat Quest is the cat's pajamas (sorry, had to!), a charming action RPG that'll have you purr-fectly entertained. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, this game looks like a total kitten-killer\" - but trust me, it's a fun romp! With adorable visuals, solid RPG action, and an overall charming feline adventure, Cat Quest is best enjoyed in bursts to avoid the otherwise repetitive quest structure (Worth Playing, March 2018).<br><br>Now, I'm no expert (I mean, have you seen my cat? It's like it's running the show around here!), but even Nintendo Life agrees: \"Cat Quest may be polished, but it has a few downsides\" - like, for example, being too darn cute (December 6, 2017). Okay, maybe that's just me.<br><br>SpazioGames thinks Cat Quest is \"strongly hindered by its original mobile game nature,\" which sounds like a real bummer (November 19, 2017). But hey, even with simplification and short longevity, it can still bring a smile to gamers - especially if you're a cat lover!<br><br>NintendoWorldReport says Cat Quest is \"a fun romp\" that's aware of its goofy setup and relishes in a sea of cat puns (November 14, 2017). I mean, who doesn't love a good cat pun? Even God is a Geek thinks it's \"a lovely action RPG that will be enjoyable for newcomers to RPGs and veterans who like cats\" (November 20, 2017).<br><br>And Cubed3 agrees: Cat Quest is an ideal little RPG for youngsters and those who love all things feline - but warns of difficulty jumps that might require a helping hand (December 8, 2017). Meanwhile, Digitally Downloaded thinks it's a reductive game that strips the RPG formula to its roots, making it feel tiresome towards the end (November 13, 2017). Okay, I guess some cats just aren't as cute as others...<br><br>So, if you're ready for a whisker-ific adventure that'll have you paws-itively entertained, then Cat Quest is the purr-fect game for you! Just don't say I didn't warn you about all those cat puns...",
