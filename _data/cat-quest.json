    "comment": "Hippo Penny - Here comes another delightful review from yours truly! <br><br>Alright, let's get this purr-ty started! Cat Quest is a game that will have you hooked on its cute visuals, solid RPG action, and an overall charming feline adventure. It's like a catnip-fueled dream come true! But don't just take my word for it; check out what the \"Worth Playing\" critic had to say: \"Cat Quest offers cute visuals, solid RPG action, and an overall charming feline adventure...and it's best enjoyed in bursts to avoid the otherwise repetitive quest structure.\" Oh yeah, I'm totally guilty of that - I played it in short bursts and got hooked! <br><br>Now, what about the \"Nintendo Life\" critic? They said: \"As polished as Cat Quest may be, it does have a few downsides. The strong focus on cats and endless supply of cat puns is obviously not a world everyone will want to immerse themselves in...especially if you are a dog lover.\" Okay, okay, I get it - cat lovers unite! But seriously, the game does have some minor issues, like the repetitive quest structure mentioned earlier.<br><br>Next up, we have \"SpazioGames\", who gave Cat Quest a score of 60. They said: \"Cat Quest is strongly hindered by its original mobile game nature, but even with the excessive simplification of mechanics and short longevity it can bring a smile to gamers, providing to be accessible even for inexperienced players.\" Yeah, that's what I thought - it's not a super complex game, but it's fun and easy to pick up!<br><br>The \"NintendoWorldReport\" critic had some similar sentiments: \"This is a game that is aware of its goofy setup and relishes in a sea of cat puns and insanity. It's not a terribly long game...but it's a fun romp with a straightforward and entertaining action RPG style.\" Yeah, that sounds like my kind of game! <br><br>Now we're on to \"God is a Geek\", who gave Cat Quest an impressive 80 score: \"Cat Quest is a lovely action RPG that will be enjoyable for newcomers to RPGs and veterans who like cats.\" Well, I'm definitely a veteran cat lover (and let's not forget, a cat pun aficionado!), and I had a blast playing this game! <br><br>Last but certainly not least, we have \"Cubed3\", who said: \"Cat Quest is an ideal little RPG to introduce to youngsters...especially given the charming pun-filled script and plentiful kitties, but those jumps in difficulty can mean a helping hand may be required on more than a few occasions.\" Ah, yes - it's definitely a game that younger players might enjoy!<br><br>Finally, we have \"Digitally Downloaded\", who gave Cat Quest a score of 60: \"It remains true that Cat Quest is a hugely reductive game that strips the RPG formula to its very roots, and that lack of depth becomes tiresome towards the end.\" Well, I won't argue with that - it's definitely not a super deep or complex game. But hey, sometimes you just want something light and fun! <br><br>And there you have it, folks! That's my take on Cat Quest - a delightful little RPG that's perfect for cat lovers and newcomers to the genre alike!",
