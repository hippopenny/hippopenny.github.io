    "comment": "Hippo Penny! It's your boy, back with another review that's paws-itive (get it? because it's about cats?). Today, we're diving into the whisker-ific world of Cat Quest, an action RPG that's got everyone purr-fectly hooked.<br><br>Let's start with the obvious: this game is cute. Like, seriously cute. You play as a cat, and let me tell you, those little furballs are adorable. From their bouncy animations to their silly antics, it's hard not to smile while playing Cat Quest. But don't worry, it's not all just looks – beneath its cutesy exterior lies a solid RPG that'll keep you engaged for hours.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But [Reviewer Guy], what about the repetitive quest structure?\" Well, let me tell you, I agree. It does get a bit same-same-same at times. But hey, even Worth Playing (score: 78) mentioned that, so don't worry, it's not just me being lazy.<br><br>On the flip side, Nintendo Life (score: 70) praised Cat Quest for its \"functional role-playing game\" design. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good pun-filled script? I mean, SpazioGames (score: 60) might've called it out for being too simplistic, but come on – it's a cat game! You can't have too much silliness in the world.<br><br>Now, before you start thinking I'm all about the fluff (get it?), let me say that Cat Quest is more than just cute visuals. It's got some serious RPG chops, with an engaging action system and plenty of variety to keep things fresh. Even God is a Geek (score: 80) agreed, calling it a \"lovely action RPG\"!<br><br>But hey, what really gets me excited is the way Cat Quest shines when shared with friends – or in this case, family members who are cat-obsessed enough to play along (like my sister, for example). It's like having your own little feline adventure party!<br><br>All in all, if you're looking for a lighthearted RPG that's more about charm than complexity, Cat Quest is the purr-fect choice. And hey, even Cubed3 (score: 70) thought it was a \"lovely, if short\" Zelda-like adventure worth checking out!<br><br>That's all for today, folks! Hope you enjoyed this review as much as I did. If not, well – at least the cats are cute, right?",
