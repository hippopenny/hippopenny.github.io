I mean, who doesn't love a good cat pun-filled RPG? <br><br>Now, let me get this straight: some critics are saying Cat Quest is a solid RPG with cute visuals and all that jazz. And hey, they're not wrong! The game does deliver on its promise of being an adorable feline adventure. But, as we all know, there's more to a game than just cuteness (although, let's be real, that's a pretty great start).<br><br>Worth Playing gives Cat Quest 78/100, praising the visuals and RPG action. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It's cute. And Nintendo Life chimes in with a score of 70, saying that while the game may not appeal to dog lovers (what's wrong with those guys?), it's still a functional RPG that can be enjoyed in short or long bursts.<br><br>But then there are the critics who think Cat Quest is, well, let's say... simplified. SpazioGames gives it 60, saying that its original mobile game nature holds it back. Yeah, I get what they mean. And Digitally Downloaded agrees, giving it 60 as well. They're like the cat critics equivalent of Scrooge McDuck - grumpy and not impressed by all that cute.<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, we have God is a Geek with its 80/100 score, saying Cat Quest is lovely and enjoyable for both newcomers and veterans. Yeah, I'm on board with that! And Cubed3 gives it 70, saying it's perfect for youngsters, especially if they love cats (which, let's be real, who doesn't?).<br><br>So what's the verdict here? Well, I'll just say this: Cat Quest is a fun little RPG that's all about embracing your inner cat lady or gentleman. It may not be the deepest game out there, but it's definitely worth a playthrough if you're in the mood for some lighthearted feline adventures.<br><br>And hey, who knows? Maybe one day we'll see Cat Quest: The Movie - Furry Edition. A cat can dream, right?<br><br>That's all for now, folks! Hippo Penny signing off.",
