Sounds like a real purr-fect storm of cuteness and fun, right? Well, let me tell you, it's not all just a bunch of mew-velous nonsense! <br><br>But before I dive in, can I just say that some critics out there need to lighten up? I mean, come on, Worth Playing gave it 78/100 and said it was \"best enjoyed in bursts\"? What does that even mean?! Do they want me to mainline this game like a cat chasing a laser pointer? And Nintendo Life calling the focus on cats \"obviously not for everyone\" but then proceeds to pan the game's design because it's too \"basic\"? Give me a break! It's a cat game, folks - we're gonna keep it cute and simple!<br><br>Okay, okay, I'll get back to the review. So, Cat Quest is an action RPG that lets you play as a cat (because who wouldn't want that?) and go on quests to save your feline friends from... well, whatever evil forces are trying to steal their whiskers. The gameplay's solid - you can slash at enemies with your sword or cast spells to turn them into, um, catnip-filled mice (it's a thing). It's easy enough for kids, but still has some challenge to keep things interesting.<br><br>Now, I know some of the critics out there were a little meh about this game. SpazioGames said it was \"strongly hindered\" by being a mobile game port, and Digitally Downloaded called it \"reductive\" and lacking in depth. But hey, sometimes simplicity can be a good thing! And honestly, I had more fun playing Cat Quest than some of those other RPGs that take themselves too seriously.<br><br>So, should you play Cat Quest? Absolutely - especially if you're a cat lover (or just a lover of cats, period). It's a charming little game that won't drain your life away with its short length. And who knows, maybe you'll even learn some cat puns along the way!",
