So, I'm gonna give you the lowdown on this feline-filled RPG. Worth Playing gave it a score of 78, saying it's cute, has solid RPG action, and is best enjoyed in bursts (ahem, same here, folks!). They did mention that the repetitive quest structure might get old, but hey, who doesn't love a good cat nap every now and then?<br><br>Nintendo Life chimed in with a score of 70, praising its polished design, but warning that it's not for everyone - especially those dog lovers out there (sorry, pup fans!). They did say it's a functional RPG for short or long play sessions, so if you're a cat lover like me, this might be just the ticket!<br><br>SpazioGames gave it a score of 60, saying it's hindered by its mobile game roots. Yeah, I can see that - it's not exactly the most complex game out there. But hey, at least it's accessible to newbies and provides some feline fun! *purrs*<br><br>Nintendo World Report scored it 70 as well, calling it a fun romp with a straightforward action RPG style. They said it won't stick with them for too long (I can relate - I had cat-itude fatigue after a few hours!), but it's a pleasant time all the same!<br><br>God is a Geek gave it an impressive score of 80, saying it's lovely and enjoyable for both newcomers to RPGs and veterans who love cats. *paws up* Ah, yes! That sounds purr-fectly delightful!<br><br>Cubed3 scored it 70 as well, calling it an ideal little RPG for youngsters (aww, cute!). They said the script is pun-filled and plentiful kitties abound - just what I ordered!<br><br>Digitally Downloaded gave it a score of 60, saying it's reductive and lacks depth. Yeah, I can see that too... but at least it doesn't overstay its welcome! *giggles*<br><br>So, there you have it! Cat Quest might not be the most complex game out there, but it's definitely a fun little romp for cat lovers of all ages! If you're looking for some light-hearted feline adventure, grab your sword and magic spells, and get ready to paw-ty with Cat Quest!<br><br>*Flicks hair* That's my take on Cat Quest! What do you think, readers? Do you have a purr-fectly delightful time with this game? Share your thoughts in the comments below!",
