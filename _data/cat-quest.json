    "comment": "Hippo Penny! It's your buddy, a seasonal grok video game reviewer, here to give you the lowdown on Cat Quest. This charming action RPG is all about cats – and I mean, who doesn't love a good cat pun every now and then?<br><br>I've been poking fun at my fellow critics, saying they're \"purr-fectly\" biased towards felines (sorry, had to!). But in all seriousness, what do the experts think? Let's see...<br><br>Worth Playing thinks Cat Quest is \"cute\" and has \"solid RPG action.\" They just wish it wasn't so repetitive. Fair enough! I mean, who doesn't love a good catnap?<br><br>Nintendo Life says it's \"functional,\" but you might not be ready for the whole cat-titude thing if you're a dog lover. Zing!<br><br>SpazioGames calls it \"accessible\" and fun, even for inexperienced players. That's what I call a purr-fectly lovely review!<br><br>NintendoWorldReport loves the goofy humor and straightforward action RPG style. They just wish it was longer (aw, shucks!). Who needs a cat-astrophe when you can have more game?<br><br>God is a Geek says Cat Quest is \"lovely\" for both newcomers and veterans who love cats. Purr-fectly reasonable!<br><br>Cubed3 thinks it's ideal for youngsters, with a charming script and plenty of kitties. Older feline fans will enjoy the Zelda-like adventure too! Aww, thanks Cubed3!<br><br>Digitally Downloaded says Cat Quest is \"reductive\" and lacks depth. But hey, at least it doesn't outstay its welcome!<br><br>And that's my two cents (or should I say, my paw-ments?) on Cat Quest! It may not be a cat-tastrophe, but it's definitely a fun romp for fans of action RPGs. So go ahead, indulge in some feline frivolity – your whiskers will thank you!<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go... I mean, I have to \"purr-use\" the couch for a bit.",
