And by \"everyone\", I mean the critics! *wink* Let's get the party started with But Why Tho?'s review - they gave it a solid 90%! They loved how the game hones in on speed, adaptability, and efficiency, making you feel like a boss navigating those levels.<br><br>Next up, we've got God is a Geek, who also raved about I Am Your Beast. They praised its fast-paced action, simplicity, and John Wick-esque vibe - after all, who doesn't love being the ultimate cool cat? <br><br>Now, let's talk about Destructoid, who handed out an 80%. They called the combat system \"fast and chaotic\", yet still remained intuitive. That's some impressive stuff right there! And hey, maybe we can apply those principles to a longer game... just saying.<br><br>GLHF on Sports Illustrated weighed in with a score of 70, saying it's not a game they'll revisit anytime soon - but boy, was it fun while it lasted! They loved the adrenaline rush and excitement, making it an unforgettable experience.<br><br>GamingTrend also chimed in with a 70%, mentioning that I Am Your Beast has some jank (that's gaming speak for \"glitches\", my friends), but what's there is fun. And hey, who doesn't love wishlisting a game on Steam?<br><br>Last but not least, IGN dropped their 70% review, praising the game's responsiveness and arsenal of weapons. They even likened it to being a one-man army! The only drawback? It might not have that extra special something to make it truly stand out.<br><br>And finally, Slant Magazine summed it up with just three words: \"Sprint, slide, parkour!\" That sounds like a thrill ride, if you ask me!<br><br>All in all, I Am Your Beast seems to be a wild ride, folks! With some ups and downs (see what I did there?), critics have shared their take on this action-packed gem. So grab your controllers, put on your dancing shoes, and get ready to experience the excitement for yourself!",
