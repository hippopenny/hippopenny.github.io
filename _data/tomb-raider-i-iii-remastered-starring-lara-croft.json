    "comment": "Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft provides a nostalgic trip for fans but may leave modern players feeling a bit janky. The lovingly crafted remasters bring back the iconic Lara Croft and her adventures from the PS1 era, offering an incredible amount of content for a bargain price. While the updated visuals and optional quality-of-life improvements add charm, the core gameplay still feels rooted in early 3D jankiness and may be a challenge to navigate for newcomers. However, the collection flawlessly reframes the classics, maintaining everything that made the games enjoyable. Despite occasional control, lighting, and camera issues, this remastered collection is a must-have for fans of the series seeking a trip down memory lane.",
