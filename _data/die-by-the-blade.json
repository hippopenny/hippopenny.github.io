This samurai dueler has gotten a raw deal from some of the big-name reviewers out there. Now, I'm not here to sugarcoat things - the game's got its flaws, but does that mean it deserves all the hate?<br><br>I'll give you three guesses what my first impression was when I started playing Die By The Blade: \"Bushido Blade with a new coat of paint.\" Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking - isn't Bushido Blade just an old, dusty franchise? Well, yes and no. See, the original game was a cult classic among certain circles, and Die By The Blade tries to recapture that magic.<br><br>Now, let's get to some of these other critics, shall we? God is a Geek gave it a dismal 45 - \"a few good ideas in its sheathe, but ultimately it fails to generate any genuine excitement.\" Zing! I mean, come on, guys. You can't just dismiss a game because it doesn't blow your mind from the get-go.<br><br>The Games Machine was a bit more kind, giving it a 65. \"Die by the Blade works in its video game mission that pays homage to Bushido Blade... for the rest, it is a huge wasted opportunity given that the title lacks all the contents.\" Ah, yes, the old \"content\" complaint. You know what? Sometimes I think critics just like to complain about content. Like, dude, if you want more game, just play more of it!<br><br>CGMagazine got all grumpy on me with a 50. \"I really wanted to like Die By The Blade, but clunky controls, half-baked gameplay and a lack of content make this less a Dual of Fates and more a battle of attrition.\" Well, you know what they say - when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. And when life gives you clunky controls, just... well, I'm not sure.<br><br>Wccftech really went off on Die By The Blade, giving it a 47. \"Solid core mechanics are not enough to make Die by the Blade the compelling spiritual sequel of the Bushido Blade series fans have been waiting for a long time.\" Ouch, burn! But let's be real - Wccftech was expecting way too much from this game.<br><br>Finger Guns gave it an 80, saying, \"At its heart, Die By The Blade is an addictive and brutal swordplay dueller that will definitely appeal to those that like lightning-fast fights.\" Ah, yes! Finally, someone gets it! Die By The Blade is all about that sweet, sweet swordplay.<br><br>GamingBolt gave it a 50, saying, \"A straightforward 1v1 samurai fighting game with very little content on its bones. Fine if you just want some quick and fun matches against friends, but there's not enough here to hold interest for long.\" Yeah, yeah, I get it. It's a niche game.<br><br>And finally, GameMAG gave it a 50, saying, \"As of right now Die by the Blade feels like an early access title marked as a full-fledged release.\" Well, what can I say? Some people just like to be negative for the sake of being negative. <br><br>So, what's my verdict on Die By The Blade? It's not perfect, but it's a solid addition to the fighting game genre. If you're looking for some quick and dirty swordplay action, then this might be the game for you. Just don't expect too much - it is what it is.",
