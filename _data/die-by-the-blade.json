But, let's be real, the critics are already having at it. God is a Geek gave it 45/100, saying it had some good ideas but ultimately failed to generate excitement. The Games Machine said it worked for its mission to pay homage to Bushido Blade, but that was about it. CGMagazine called it clunky and half-baked, while Wccftech said it was hard to recommend due to bland design, slow progression, and a lack of content.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What's the point of reading this review when everyone else has already trashed the game?\" Well, my friend, that's where I come in - Hippo Penny, the seasonal grok reviewer with a witty sense of humor (if I do say so myself). I'm here to give you the lowdown on what makes Die By The Blade tick, or rather, doesn't tick.<br><br>Gameplay-wise, Die By The Blade is all about those lightning-fast fights. And, let me tell you, it's addictive! You'll find yourself swinging your sword and dodging attacks like a pro (or, at least, that's the idea). However, the lack of real narrative and slow progression might have you questioning whether this game is more than just a quick fix.<br><br>Finger Guns gave it 80/100 for being an \"addictive and brutal swordplay dueller\" - I agree! But, where they fell short was in expecting a full release title. GameMAG echoed similar sentiments, saying it felt like early access material. GamingBolt summed it up nicely: a straightforward fighting game with little content.<br><br>Now, I'm not here to sugarcoat things. Die By The Blade has its issues - clunky animations, slow progression, and a lack of content. But, hey, if you're looking for some quick matches against friends, it's fine. Just don't expect much beyond that.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I'll let my grok-fueled senses be my guide... Hippo Penny gives Die By The Blade (drumroll) - a rating that says more about me than the game itself. Hehe!<br><br>That's it for now! Keep it groovy, folks!",
