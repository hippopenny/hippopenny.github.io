    "comment": "Hippo Penny - Get ready for some seriously sharp swordplay and even sharper criticism!<br><br>Die By The Blade is a game that's got everyone talking - or rather, not talking. With a scorecard full of mediocre reviews, I'm left wondering: what's the point of all these samurai squabbles?<br><br>Let's start with God is a Geek, who gave it 45 points. Oh, die by the blade alright - by boredom, that is. The critic's comment? \"Die By The Blade has a few good ideas in its sheathe, but ultimately it fails to generate any genuine excitement.\" Zing!<br><br>Next up is The Games Machine with their 65-point score. Now, I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it's like watching Bushido Blade on repeat - nice try, but where's the variety? \"Die By The Blade works in its video game mission that pays homage to Bushido Blade... for the rest, it is a huge wasted opportunity given that the title lacks all the contents.\" Yeah, I get it. Content = king.<br><br>CGMagazine chimed in with their 50-point score: \"I really wanted to like Die By The Blade, but clunky controls, half-baked gameplay and a lack of content make this less a Dual of Fates and more a battle of attrition.\" Ouch! It's like playing a game of tag with someone who keeps tripping over their own feet.<br><br>Wccftech also gave it 47 points: \"Solid core mechanics are not enough to make Die by the Blade the compelling spiritual sequel of the Bushido Blade series fans have been waiting for... Bland character design, clunky animations, horrendously slow progression system, extreme lack of content and mediocre visuals are only some of the issues that mar an experience that is very hard to recommend to anyone in its current state.\" Woah, that's a long list of complaints!<br><br>Finger Guns, on the other hand, gave it 80 points: \"At its heart, Die By The Blade is an addictive and brutal swordplay dueller that will definitely appeal to those that like lightning-fast fights... But without any real narrative and a snail's pace rewards progression, it falls short in what should feel like a full release title.\" Ah, the eternal struggle between style and substance!<br><br>GamingBolt and GameMAG both gave it 50 points: \"A straightforward 1v1 samurai fighting game with very little content on its bones,\" says GamingBolt. And GameMAG agrees: \"As of right now Die by the Blade feels like an early access title marked as a full-fledged release.\" Yeah, that's not exactly what I'd want to hear about my favorite game.<br><br>In conclusion, Die By The Blade is like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces - it's got some nice ideas, but ultimately falls flat. Maybe someday, it'll find its way back to the drawing board and come out swinging (pun intended). Until then, I'll just be over here, sharpening my wit... and maybe my swordplay skills.<br><br>That's Hippo Penny for you!",
