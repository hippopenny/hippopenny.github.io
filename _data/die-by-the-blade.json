It's your boy, [Seasonal Grok], back with another review that's guaranteed to make you LOL, cry, and maybe even join a samurai training camp (not really, but I won't judge).<br><br>Die By The Blade is the latest 1v1 fighting game that's all about swordplay and... well, more swordplay. I mean, who doesn't love a good duel, right? But let me tell you, this game isn't without its flaws. Or should I say, its lack of content (more on that later).<br><br>Now, before I dive into the nitty-gritty, I just want to say that some critics have been harsher than others. God is a Geek gave it a 45, stating it's a \"huge wasted opportunity.\" Ouch! The Games Machine went easy with a 65, saying it \"works\" in its own little way (yeah, no kidding!). Meanwhile, CGMagazine and Wccftech were like, \"Uh, this game is a mess.\" They gave it 50s, citing clunky controls, lack of content, and a slow progression system. On the other end of the spectrum, Finger Guns was all about Die By The Blade's addictive gameplay (80!), while GamingBolt and GameMAG were like, \"It's fine, I guess\" (50 each).<br><br>Now that we've got our critic friends out of the way, let me tell you what I think. I mean, the game has some nice ideas going on – those sword fights are intense! But ultimately, it feels like a bare-bones release with no real narrative to speak of. And don't even get me started on the lack of content. It's like they took all their creative energy and put it into one or two levels (I'm looking at you, Bushido Blade homage!). The rest is just... meh.<br><br>In conclusion, Die By The Blade has some great moments, but it falls short in what feels like a full release title. Maybe with more time and content, it'll be the compelling spiritual sequel fans have been waiting for (sigh). For now, it's a solid 1v1 fighting game for die-hard fans of the genre... or those who just want some quick and fun matches against friends.<br><br>And that's my Hippo Penny review – see you in the next one, folks!",
