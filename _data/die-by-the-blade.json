But before I dive into the good stuff, let's take a look at what some of my fellow critics are saying.<br><br>God is a Geek gives it 45/100, saying it \"fails to generate any genuine excitement.\" Ouch! The Games Machine is a bit more generous with their 65/100, praising the game's homage to Bushido Blade. CGMagazine comes in at 50/100, citing clunky controls and a lack of content. And Wccftech? Well, they're being harsh, giving it just 47/100 for its poor design, animations, and progression system. <br><br>Finger Guns is the most optimistic of the bunch, handing out an 80/100 for its addictive swordplay duels. VG247 gives it a 40/100, saying it's got some golden moments but is otherwise burdened by issues. And finally, Try Hard Guides is right with their 80/100, praising the game's fast-paced combat and exciting gameplay.<br><br>So what's my take? Well, I'll be honest - I was a bit underwhelmed at first. The controls took some getting used to, and the lack of content might make it feel a bit shallow. BUT - when things clicked, oh man, did they click! There's something so satisfying about slicing through an opponent with a well-timed combo.<br><br>In the end, Die By The Blade is like that one friend who's always up for a good fight. It's got its flaws, but it's also got some serious potential. If you're a fan of Bushido Blade or just looking for a new sword-fighting experience, give this one a shot. Just be prepared to get a little salty when things don't go your way.<br><br>That's my two cents - what do you think? Have you given Die By The Blade a try? Let me know in the comments!",
