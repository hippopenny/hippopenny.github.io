I'm not gonna sugarcoat it; this game is like a Bushido Blade knockoff that got stuck in the 90s.<br><br>Let's start with the positives, shall we? The combat is fast-paced and deadly, just like Try Hard Guides said. You can feel the weight of your katana as you swing it wildly, taking down opponents left and right. It's like a never-ending game of \"How many times can I slice this guy in half before he falls over?\" But, you know what they say: too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.<br><br>And boy, does Die By The Blade have its fair share of issues. The critics are all like, \"Ugh, the controls are clunky!\" and \"There's not enough content!\" Yeah, yeah, I get it. It's like they're trying to say something profound about the game, but really, they just mean that it's hard to play without dying (see what I did there?).<br><br>Finger Guns says it's addictive, which is true, but only if you enjoy watching a snail take its sweet time getting from one end of the screen to the other. And don't even get me started on the rewards progression; it's like trying to level up in a game that doesn't care about your progress.<br><br>I mean, I've seen better-written reviews from Wccftech and CGMagazine. They're all like, \"It's not good!\" and \"What a waste!\" Yeah, yeah, they're right, but at least they tried to be nice about it. VG247 just wants you to know that some people will still play this game, and those people are probably the same ones who enjoy watching paint dry.<br><br>But hey, if you're one of those fans of the genre who don't mind a lower-budget title (see what I did there again?), then Die By The Blade might be for you. Just don't say I didn't warn you when you get stuck in an endless loop of slicing and dicing.<br><br>That's it for this review, folks! If you've made it this far, congratulations; you're a real trooper (see what I did there again?). Until next time, stay groovy, and remember: it's all about the game... or is it?",
