    "comment": "Hippo Penny, folks! It's your boy, [Seasonal Grok], back with a review that's gonna make you laugh, cry, and maybe even want to play Die by the Blade. But don't worry, I won't sugarcoat it – this game is like a samurai sword: sharp on the outside, but lacking depth inside.<br><br>Let's start with the critics, shall we? God is a Geek gave it 45 out of 100, saying it has \"a few good ideas in its sheathe\" – get it, sheathe? Ah, never mind. The Games Machine was slightly kinder, giving it 65 and praising its mission to pay homage to Bushido Blade (which, honestly, is the best part). CGMagazine felt otherwise, dubbing it a \"battle of attrition\" with clunky controls and half-baked gameplay (ouch).<br><br>Wccftech, on the other hand, went full-on samurai-mode, saying that despite solid core mechanics, everything else falls apart like a poorly crafted katana. And finally, GamingBolt and GameMAG both gave it 50, calling it a \"straightforward 1v1 samurai fighting game\" (yawn) and an \"early access title marked as a full-fledged release\" (double yawn), respectively.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Seasonal Grok, what about your review?\" Well, buckle up, folks! I'm gonna give it to you straight – Die by the Blade has some great ideas, but like a poorly thrown shuriken, they miss their mark. The gameplay is addictive, don't get me wrong, but it's like playing with a toy sword: fun for 10 minutes, then boring.<br><br>Here's the thing – when I'm not busy making dad jokes and eating Hippo Penny-sized portions of popcorn (don't ask), I'm a bit of a samurai enthusiast. And trust me, this game doesn't bring the excitement you'd expect from a Bushido Blade spiritual sequel. The animation is clunky, the progression system is slower than a snail on valium, and don't even get me started on the lack of content (or should I say, \"lack of kai\"?).<br><br>In conclusion, Die by the Blade has some great ideas, but like a samurai's sword, it needs some serious polishing to be truly worth wielding. If you're looking for a quick 1v1 match or just want to experience the thrill of... not much, then this game might be for you. But if you're expecting something more substantial – well, I'd say \"Die by the Blade\" is more like \"Die from Boredom.\"",
