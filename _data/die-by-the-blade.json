I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned duel-to-the-death with some fancy swordplay? Am I right, or am I right?<br><br>Now, before we dive into the review, let me just say that I'm not exactly thrilled about having to summarize all these critics' opinions. I mean, it's like asking me to binge-watch an entire season of a TV show and then tell you what happened in every episode... zzz...<br><br>BUT, since I love being the grok reviewer extraordinaire, I shall soldier on! So, without further ado, let's get this sword-fighting party started!<br><br>First up, we have God is a Geek giving Die By The Blade a score of 45. Their comment? \"Die by the Blade has a few good ideas in its sheathe, but ultimately it fails to generate any genuine excitement.\" Um, yeah... that sounds about right. I mean, who doesn't love a little excitement in their dueling life?<br><br>Next up is The Games Machine with a score of 65. Their review says: \"Die by the Blade works in its video game mission that pays homage to Bushido Blade. for the rest, it is a huge wasted opportunity given that the title lacks all the contents.\" Yeah... I mean, who doesn't love a good Bushido Blade reference? But seriously, lacking content is like being stuck in a never-ending loop of sword fights...<br><br>CGMagazine scores Die By The Blade 50 and says: \"I really wanted to like Die By The Blade, but clunky controls, half-baked gameplay and a lack of content make this less a Dual of Fates and more a battle of attrition.\" Yikes... I mean, who wants to be stuck in an endless battle of attrition? Not me!<br><br>Wccftech gives it 47 and says: \"Solid core mechanics are not enough to make Die by the Blade the compelling spiritual sequel of the Bushido Blade series fans have been waiting for a long time. Bland character design, clunky animations, horrendously slow progression system, extreme lack of content and mediocre visuals are only some of the issues that mar an experience that is very hard to recommend to anyone in its current state.\" Uh... yeah...<br><br>Finger Guns scores it 80 and says: \"At its heart, Die By The Blade is an addictive and brutal swordplay dueller that will definitely appeal to those that like lightning-fast fights. But without any real narrative and a snail's pace rewards progression, it falls short in what should feel like a full release title.\" Ah... I mean, who doesn't love a little speed and action?<br><br>VG247 gives it 40 and says: \"There are golden moments here, without a doubt. But Die by the Blade is burdened by issues that I fear will stand out for many casual players interested to try it out. But as the only modern fighting game to really approach this sub-genre of 3D one-strike action perhaps it'll find its audience. I'd recommend this to genre diehards and those who don't mind a lower budget title. For the average player, I'd give this a miss for now.\" Hmm... I mean, maybe I should just stick with my trusty old sword...<br><br>Try Hard Guides scores it 80 and says: \"Die By The Blade delivers fast-paced, deadly skill-heavy combat for players to master in 1v1 battles. While not perfectly balanced, the game features some awesome cosmetics and exciting gameplay that will surely hook fans of the genre in for the long haul.\" Ah... yeah, I can get behind that!<br><br>And there you have it, folks! Die By The Blade - a game with its fair share of ups and downs. But hey, if you're a fan of swordplay and don't mind a little repetition, then maybe this is the game for you. Just remember: always keep your sword sharp... and your reviewer's opinions in check!<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
