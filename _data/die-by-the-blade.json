    "comment": "Hippo Penny!<br><br>Die by the Blade, a game that's got everyone talking - or rather, not talking, since most critics seem to be whispering, \"Meh.\" But hey, I'm here to give you the lowdown. And trust me, after reading my review, you'll be hooked (or not).<br><br>So, what's this game about? Well, imagine Bushido Blade meets... well, more Bushido Blade, with a dash of sword-fighting goodness. Sounds promising, right? Unfortunately, most critics seem to have fallen asleep halfway through the fight.<br><br>God is a Geek says Die by the Blade has \"a few good ideas in its sheathe\" (zing!), but ultimately fails to excite. The Games Machine thinks it's all about the homage, but lacks substance. CGMagazine calls it clunky with a side of half-baked gameplay and no content to speak of. Wccftech says it's hard to recommend due to... well, you get the idea.<br><br>But hey, what do I know? I'm just Hippo Penny, not some fancy-pants critic with a degree in snarkiness (although that does sound like an impressive major). Nope, I'm here to give you the real deal - my take on this game. And honestly, it's not all bad. Finger Guns says Die by the Blade is addictive and brutal, but lacking narrative and rewards progression.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, let's just say some critics are more... enthusiastic than others. Like VG247, which gives a lukewarm thumbs-down for casual players, but suggests it might find its audience among genre diehards. And then there's Try Hard Guides, which actually likes it (shock!) for its fast-paced combat and awesome cosmetics.<br><br>In conclusion, Die by the Blade is like that one friend who's always \"almost\" good enough. Almost. It's got some great ideas, but falls short in execution. So, if you're a die-hard (pun intended) fan of sword-fighting games or just looking for something new to try, well... maybe give it a shot? But for the average player, I'd say take a pass for now.<br><br>That's my two cents (or rather, Hippo Pennies). Now, go forth and game on, friends!",
