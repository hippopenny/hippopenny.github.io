I mean, who needs a positive review when you can just make fun of the critics, am I right? *winks* But hey, someone's gotta do it!<br><br>Now, let's get this review party started! We'll take a look at what these esteemed critics (ahem) had to say about Die by the Blade. Buckle up, folks!<br><br>God is a Geek: \"Die by the Blade has a few good ideas in its sheathe, but ultimately it fails to generate any genuine excitement.\" Ah, someone's being dramatic! *rolls eyes* I mean, who doesn't love a good sheathe joke?<br><br>The Games Machine: \"Die by the Blade works in its video game mission that pays homage to Bushido Blade. for the rest, it is a huge wasted opportunity given that the title lacks all the contents.\" *whispers* I think they mean \"content\"... not \"contents\"...<br><br>CGMagazine: \"I really wanted to like Die By The Blade, but clunky controls, half-baked gameplay and a lack of content make this less a Dual of Fates and more a battle of attrition.\" Ouch! Someone didn't exactly get the memo about not being mean!<br><br>Wccftech: \"Solid core mechanics are not enough to make Die by the Blade the compelling spiritual sequel of the Bushido Blade series fans have been waiting for a long time. Bland character design, clunky animations, horrendously slow progression system, extreme lack of content and mediocre visuals are only some of the issues that mar an experience that is very hard to recommend to anyone in its current state.\" *takes a deep breath* Wow... That's a mouthful!<br><br>Finger Guns: \"At its heart, Die By The Blade is an addictive and brutal swordplay dueller that will definitely appeal to those that like lightning-fast fights. But without any real narrative and a snail's pace rewards progression, it falls short in what should feel like a full release title. Let's hope time proves us wrong on this one.\" Ah, someone's a little more optimistic! *smirks* Yeah, because we all know that \"snail's pace rewards\" is exactly what most gamers are looking for!<br><br>GamingBolt: \"A straightforward 1v1 samurai fighting game with very little content on its bones. Fine if you just want some quick and fun matches against friends, but there's not enough here to hold interest for long.\" *shrugs* Hey, at least someone's honest!<br><br>VG247: \"There are golden moments here, without a doubt. But Die by the Blade is burdened by issues that I fear will stand out for many casual players interested to try it out. But as the only modern fighting game to really approach this sub-genre of 3D one-strike action perhaps it'll find its audience. I'd recommend this to genre diehards and those who don't mind a lower budget title. For the average player, I'd give this a miss for now.\" *nods* Yeah, because nothing says \"recommendable\" like \"lower budget title\"!<br><br>And that's it! *yawns* Long review, short attention span, right? Don't worry, folks, I won't make you wait too much longer for the verdict... or should I say, Hippo Penny's Seal of Approval (which is basically just a virtual sticker)? <br><br>Stay tuned for more fun and games, and don't forget to keep an eye out for those pesky search engines â€“ they might just recommend this review to you!<br><br>Hippo Penny - Time to get outta here!",
