As I dive into this game, I'm reminded of my own lack of samurai skills (or any skills, really) - but hey, someone's gotta give you the lowdown!<br><br>Now, let's see what the critics are saying. God is a Geek gave it a paltry 45%, stating that Die By The Blade has some good ideas, but ultimately fails to excite. Yeah, I can relate - sometimes even the best of games just don't hit the mark. Meanwhile, The Games Machine praised its homage to Bushido Blade, but lamented the lack of content. You know what they say: you can't have your cake and eat it too (or in this case, slice it with a katana).<br><br>Other critics like CGMagazine were more harsh, citing clunky controls, half-baked gameplay, and a lack of content that makes it less a Dual of Fates and more a battle of attrition. Yeah, I get it - sometimes games just feel like they're dragging on forever. Even Wccftech, usually a beacon of positivity, had some harsh words: bland character design, clunky animations, slow progression, and mediocre visuals are not exactly what you want to hear.<br><br>On the flip side, Finger Guns praised the addictive swordplay and brutal fights, but noted that without narrative and rewards, it falls short. A full release title? Not so much. GamingBolt also chimed in, saying Die By The Blade is a straightforward 1v1 fighter with little content - fine for some quick matches, but lacking overall. GameMAG took a more diplomatic approach, stating that as of now, the game feels like an early access title and needs improvement.<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, I'll just say this: if you're looking for a fun, light-hearted sword-fighting romp with friends, Die By The Blade might be okay. But if you're expecting a full-fledged release with depth and substance, you might want to look elsewhere. For me, it was a bit of a mixed bag - but hey, I'm just a grog trying to make the world a more hilarious place one review at a time!",
