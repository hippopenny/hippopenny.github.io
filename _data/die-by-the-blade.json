After all, when reviewers like God is a Geek (45) and CGMagazine (50) are snoring off to dreamland, it's only natural to wonder if the game's just not exciting enough.<br><br>But fear not, young gamers! Finger Guns (80), at least, saw the light. They praised the addictive swordplay dueling and lightning-fast fights – if only there were more to it than that. I mean, who doesn't love a good sword fight? It's like the ultimate game of \" Rock, Paper, Scissors\" with swords.<br><br>Now, about those criticisms... The Games Machine (65) thought Die By The Blade was just too little, too late – a wasted opportunity for greatness. Wccftech (47) took it a step further, calling it hard to recommend in its current state. And GamingBolt (50) summed it up nicely: fine for quick matches with friends, but not enough to hold interest long-term.<br><br>And then there's GameMAG (50), who basically called it an early access title masquerading as a full release. Ouch. That hurts.<br><br>Me? I'm just here for the fun. And I think Die By The Blade has some... blades of glory, if you will. It's not perfect, but hey, what is in this crazy gaming world? At least it's trying to innovate and bring something new to the table (or should I say, stage).<br><br>So, don your samurai armor, sharpen those katanas, and get ready for some epic dueling! Just don't expect a 100% satisfaction guarantee from yours truly. After all, Hippo Penny is just here for the ride... and maybe a few laughs.<br><br>Review Date: June 15, 2024",
