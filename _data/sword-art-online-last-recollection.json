    "comment": "Hippo Penny! I'm so excited to dive into this review of Sword Art Online: Last Recollection. But before we begin, let me just mention that I'm not actually sure what Hippo Penny is... maybe it's a special type of gaming console? Don't worry about it, let's get to the game!<br><br>First off, I want to talk about how great this game's action RPG feels. The combat system is super accessible and makes every encounter exciting! Siliconera nails it when they say that SAO \"manages to streamline the best systems from its MMO origins while integrating them into an action-packed adventure title.\"<br><br>But let's not forget, we have some critics (ahem) who just didn't get on board with this SAO train. Like Games Machine, who somehow ended up with a single-player and multiplayer experience that was as smooth as a toddler with ketchup-stained bib. And GameGrin? Oh boy, they thought the game's combat system was neat... but the rest? Subpar-ville!<br><br>Multiplayer.it, on the other hand, loved the innovations in the combat system (no complaints there!). But from a technical point of view? Hmm, \"few\" improvements is what I read. You think maybe that's like saying, \"I'd love to jump off this 10-foot-tall hill... and just roll gently down?\"<br>And SpazioGames, who thought JRPG was dull and uninspired? More so than my grandma when she plays solitaire for the umpteenth time.<br><br>It's really funny how IGN Adria compares Last Recollection to solving a puzzle that only fans can solve (but others will struggle with). \"Like putting together IKEA furniture without instructions\"... pretty close, right?<br><br>Sword Art Online: Last Recollection... well, I won't score it myself. Just know it has some excellent action gameplay, good combat system, but room for the plot and level design to expand more in its later chapters â€“ or is it one of those games that'll forever fall short of great expectations?<br><br>Oh look, SpazioGames called Last Recollection dull and uninspired! That means you might just get through a chapter without realizing the excitement wasn't there. If anyone (yep) you're reading this and about to give SAO:LR a try, I won't deter you... but only if you've got enough gaming guts (no offense).<br><br>In all seriousness, while Sword Art Online: Last Recollection might not reach its true potential due to some of the level design issues and its plot, I had lots of fun poking at other critics. The game itself? Well, fans will dig it, no doubt about that!",
