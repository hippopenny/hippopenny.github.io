Let's get this review party started!<br><br>As I dived into The Last of Us Part II Remastered, I couldn't help but feel like I was revisiting an old friend – one that just got a fresh new haircut and some sweet new features. And, honestly, who doesn't love a good reunion?<br><br>But let's be real, folks. This remaster isn't just about looks; it's also about substance. And boy, does it deliver! The addition of No Return mode is like the ultimate game-changer (pun intended). It adds a whole new level of tension and excitement to the already-intense combat. I mean, who wouldn't want to play as Ellie or Joel in a roguelike setting?<br><br>Now, I know some critics might say it's not worth the $10 upgrade, but honestly, I think it's a small price to pay for the amount of extra content you get. And hey, if you're one of those folks who hasn't played The Last of Us Part II yet, then this is the definitive way to experience it. Period.<br><br>Of course, not everyone agrees. Some critics (cough, PLAY! Zine, cough) seem to think that this remaster is more like a cash-grab than an actual improvement. But I'm here to tell you, folks, that's just hogwash! The Last of Us Part II Remastered is the real deal – and if you're a fan of the series or just looking for a great gaming experience, then it's totally worth your time.<br><br>So, what's my take? Well, let's just say I'm having a blast (pun intended again) playing through this remastered masterpiece. And if you ask me, it's definitely worth the price of admission – even if some critics don't agree.<br><br>That's it for now, folks! Hippo Penny out!",
