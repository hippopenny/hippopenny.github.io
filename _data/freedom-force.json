Today, I'm tackling the delightful Freedom Force, an RPG-RTS that's got everyone from netjak to Four Fat Chicks singing its praises. But before we dive in, let me just say that as a seasonal grok reviewer, I've got a reputation for being a bit... unpredictable. You know, like trying to predict which cat will be the first to knock over a vase.<br><br>Now, onto the review! Freedom Force is a game that's all about superheroes, and not just any superheroes – we're talking about a team of 'em with powers as colorful as their personalities. And let me tell you, they're a blast to play with! The combat system is surprisingly deep, especially when you factor in the various combos and special moves at your disposal. It's like being part of a superhero squad, minus the whole \"saving the world\" thing (although, you know, that does happen too).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking – \"What about the graphics?\" Well, let me put it this way: Freedom Force looks like it was plucked straight from the pages of a comic book. And who doesn't love that? The character designs are unique and fun, with each hero sporting their own set of powers and abilities. It's like having your very own superhero team, minus the whole \"being responsible for their actions\" thing (although, you know, that does happen too).<br><br>But enough about me – let's talk about the critics! netjak gives it a 90, saying it's \"refreshingly light, yet fully satisfying.\" Four Fat Chicks? A perfect score of 100, praising its ability to \"shatter genre lines\" and be fun for all ages. Even PC Gamer is on board, calling it the \"most amazing, spectacular, ultimate superhero game ever made.\" Yeah, that's a lot of superlatives.<br><br>And then there are those who didn't quite share the same enthusiasm – like Maxim Online, which gave it a 60, saying it features \"slick animation and plenty of boffo, whiz-bang special effects\" (which is code for \"it's pretty, but not that great\"). GamePen? A solid 80, praising its single-player campaign and fanbase. Armchair Empire? A whopping 94, saying it's an \"excellent game\" that restored their enthusiasm for comic characters.<br><br>So what's the verdict? Well, I think Freedom Force is a game that's got something for everyone – even me, and I'm notoriously hard to please. If you're looking for a lighthearted RPG-RTS with plenty of superhero flair, look no further! And if you don't believe me, just ask netjak, Four Fat Chicks, or PC Gamer – they'll tell you the same thing.<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
