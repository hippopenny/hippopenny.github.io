Poor guy must've had a rough day when he decided to write about this one.<br><br>So, what's the buzz around Indika? It seems like critics are divided on whether it's a masterpiece of weirdness or just plain confusing. Me? I'm all in for some good ol' fashioned weirdness, so let's dive in!<br><br>First off, the story is... well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but let's just say it's got more twists and turns than a crooked politician's alibi. You play as someone who's basically trapped in a hellish purgatory, and it's up to you to figure out what's going on and how to get out. Sound grim? Yeah, it is. But trust me, it's also kind of... fun?<br><br>Now, I know some of the other critics are saying that Indika takes too many risks and doesn't always pull them off. But I'm like, \"Hey, at least they're trying something new!\" The game's got a lot of heart (and a healthy dose of sarcasm), even if it stumbles sometimes.<br><br>Visually, Indika is like nothing else out there. It's like someone took all the weirdness from every anime and sci-fi show from the past 20 years and mashed them together in a glorious mess. I mean, what's not to love about giant, floating skulls or humanoid trees with laser eyes?<br><br>Of course, some folks might find it all too overwhelming (looking at you, Screen Rant guy). But hey, if you're up for an adventure that's equal parts bizarre and thought-provoking, then Indika is the game for you.<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, let's just say I'm glad someone made a game that's as weird as my aunt at a family reunion. Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh, but you get the idea â€“ Indika's a wild ride that'll keep you guessing and laughing (and maybe even crying, depending on how invested you are in those darn characters).<br><br>Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go play some more Indika and try to figure out what all these weird symbols mean...",
