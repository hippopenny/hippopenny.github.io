But hey, who doesn't love a good slice-of-life game every now and then? Spy x Anya: Operation Memories is that kind of game. It's like being wrapped in a warm hug on a cold winter day - it might not be the most exciting thing to do, but it's cozy, you know?<br><br>I mean, let's take what Screen Rant said with a grain of salt (or a dash of sarcasm). \"Exceptionally charming\" and \"cute\"? That's just code for \"it's a feel-good game that'll make you smile\". And who doesn't love a good smile? The mini-games are fun, the cosmetics are adorable, and dressing up Anya is basically just a digital version of playing with dolls (which, let's be real, is the best).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"But wait, isn't this game all about Spy x Family?\" Well, kind of. It's like Siliconera said - it's a lovely game that's true to the series, but it might not be the most engaging experience if you're not already invested in the world of Spy x Family. I mean, if you're new to the franchise, you might find some things lacking (like Atomix mentioned). But hey, that's just part of being a fan - you've got to do your due diligence before diving into the deep end.<br><br>And don't even get me started on INVEN and their \"heartwarming adventure\" nonsense. It's like they're trying to make me cry (which, let's be real, is not my style). But seriously, if you're a fan of Spy x Family, this game is basically just a digital version of hanging out with your favorite anime characters.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking - \"But what about the gameplay? Is it repetitive?\" Well, let me tell you - Everyeye.it got it right (as they often do). It's like playing hit-and-run games on the Nintendo Switch - it's all about taking things one step at a time. And yeah, the internal currency system might be a bit invasive, but hey, at least it gives you something to do.<br><br>So, what's my takeaway? Spy x Anya: Operation Memories is basically just a digital hug in a box (or on your Nintendo Switch). It's not going to change the world, but it's definitely worth playing if you're already invested in the series. And hey, who knows - maybe you'll even discover some new favorite moments or characters.<br><br>That's all for now, folks! See you in the next review - Hippo Penny out!",
