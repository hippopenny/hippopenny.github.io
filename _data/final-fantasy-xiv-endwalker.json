As a seasonal grog, I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this epic expansion with you.<br><br>First off, let me just say that the folks at Square Enix have outdone themselves (again). The attention to detail, the world-building, and the storytelling are all top-notch. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack – it's like a symphony of awesomeness!<br><br>Now, I know some critics might be saying things like, \"Oh, it's just more of the same old FFXIV,\" or \"The pacing is off,\" but honestly, folks, I think that's just being too critical. Endwalker is an emotional ride from start to finish, and if you're a fan of the series (like me!), you'll be completely invested in the story.<br><br>And let's not forget about the gameplay – it's as smooth as ever, with new jobs, dungeons, and all sorts of goodies to keep things fresh. I mean, what more could you ask for?<br><br>Of course, there are some minor quibbles here and there (padding in certain areas, reusing assets), but honestly, they're just that – minor. The bigger picture is what matters, and Endwalker delivers in spades.<br><br>So, if you're a fan of FFXIV or just looking for an epic RPG experience, I highly recommend giving Endwalker a go. Trust me, it'll be worth your while!<br><br>And to my fellow critics out there (hello, Noisy Pixel, RPG Fan, Easy Allies, Gamer Escape, Hardcore Gamer, and PC Gamer!), don't worry if you didn't quite agree on the scores – we're all just trying to help gamers make informed decisions, right?<br><br>So, what do you think about Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker?
