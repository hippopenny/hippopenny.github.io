    "comment": "Metro Quester offers a uniquely intense RPG experience that challenges players to survive in a minimalist post-apocalyptic Japan. The game's focus on statistics and resource management may not be for everyone, but those who embrace the challenge will find a deeply rewarding gameplay loop. With strategic combat and the freedom to craft your own story, Metro Quester delivers a refreshing departure from the standard JRPG clones. While it may lack in teaching the player its systems, the game's user-friendly interface and immersive world make it a must-try for RPG enthusiasts looking for a distinct and thought-provoking adventure.",
