Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 surprised me with its fun, family-friendly gameplay and... well, let's just say it's not as cringeworthy as some other platform fighters out there.<br><br>But I digress. What did the critics have to say? Well, according to PlayStation Universe, \"Refining and building on what came before, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is a wholesale improvement from the original game.\" High praise indeed! And Destructoid agrees, saying it's \"worth trying out\" with its new movesets and stellar online netcode.<br><br>Game Informer calls it a \"successful second attempt,\" while PSX Brasil thinks it's a \"natural evolution\" of the first title. Even God is a Geek, which gave it a lower score than some of the other critics, says it's still \"really entertaining\" - just with some issues, of course.<br><br>Meanwhile, Video Chums and Game Rant seem to be in agreement that it's not exactly setting the world on fire, but hey, if you're a fan of the featured franchises (I'm looking at you, SpongeBob SquarePants fans!), you'll still have a blast.<br><br>And that's my Hippo Penny review of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2! It's not going to revolutionize the genre or anything, but it's definitely worth trying out if you're in the mood for some goofy, fun platform fighting. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go practice my Splat-O-Vision skills...",
