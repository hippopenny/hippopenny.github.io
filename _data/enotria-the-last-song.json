But let's get to the juicy stuff â€“ what do our top critics think?<br><br>Voxel gives it a solid 88, praising the well-constructed scenarios and bold theme. They're impressed by how easily Enotria wins over even non-fans of Souls-like games.<br><br>SpazioGames agrees, highlighting the game's deep connection to Italian folklore and its rich cultural heritage. They celebrate the natural wonders of Italy and its theatrical traditions, making this Souls-like stand out from the crowd.<br><br>COGconnected weighs in with a 74, mentioning the delightful setting, theatre-infused narrative, and mechanical depth. However, they note that some mechanics can feel poorly explained or unnecessary.<br><br>Checkpoint Gaming delivers a 70, emphasizing the game's melee combat and magic system. While not all elements work individually, the game's RPG mechanics and challenging boss fights make it a worthwhile addition to any Souls-like fan's library.<br><br>Areajugones also scores a 70, praising Enotria's visual beauty and thematic originality. However, they criticize the mask system for being poorly balanced and combat for having imprecise controls and limiting gameplay.<br><br>MGG gives Enotria a 65, saying it's decent but doesn't know how to use its ideas. Combat balancing issues and a limited lifespan are major drawbacks in this well-saturated genre.<br><br>And finally, PC Gamer dishes out a 57, stating that while Italian folklore is unique, the game lacks smooth combat and smart mechanics, making it an average Souls-like experience.<br><br>Grok to your conclusion? I think Enotria: The Last Song is worth exploring, especially for its setting and combat mechanics. The criticisms are valid, but hey, even a 57 from PC Gamer can't bring me down! It's time to Grok into the action RPG world!<br><br>What do you guys think? Share your thoughts in the comments below!",
