    "comment": "Hippo Penny - Here's my review of Cricket 24, the latest installment in the Big Ant Studios series. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, folks; this game is a bit like me - a work in progress.<br><br>First off, let me say that Cricket 24 is an improvement over its predecessor, Cricket 22. The visuals are better, the presentation is snazzier, and the gameplay is more refined. But, and I mean BIG but, it's still missing that certain je ne sais quoi that makes it truly stand out.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Grok, why can't this game just be like the other sports games out there?\" Well, let me tell you, my friends, Cricket 24 is trying to carve out its own niche in the market. It's got a unique charm, and when it gets things right, it can be really something special.<br><br>But, as I said earlier, it's still a work in progress. The AI could be smoother, the licensed players are lacking, and the presentation could use some more polish. And don't even get me started on the online lobbies - they're barren, folks! It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna lie; some critics have been a bit harsher on Cricket 24 than others. IGN gave it a score of 50 and said that it's \"a bit too inconsistent overall\" and \"lacks the confidence or creativity to advance further down the wicket.\" Ouch! Meanwhile, Digitally Downloaded gave it a score of 90 and said that \"Big Ant would be to start capturing the nuances of the sport and convert excellent ball-to-ball action to give us the full match experience.\" Ah, nice and sunny over there!<br><br>All in all, Cricket 24 is an improvement over its predecessor, but it's still got some growing pains to work through. If you're a die-hard cricket fan or looking for a new game to get stuck into, this might be worth checking out. But if you're expecting something on the level of EA Sports or Sony's sports titles, you might want to look elsewhere.<br><br>That's my two cents on Cricket 24 - Hippo Penny approved!",
