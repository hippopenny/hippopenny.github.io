    "comment": "Hippo Penny - Here we go again, folks! Another cricket game review, and I'm not just winging it (pun intended). Cricket 24 is the latest installment in the series, and I'm here to give you the lowdown.<br><br>First off, let's get the obvious out of the way: the critics are divided. IGN gives it a mediocre 50/100, saying it's like a decent English opener - good for stretches, but inconsistent overall. Meanwhile, Digitally Downloaded thinks Big Ant can do better, scoring it 90/100 and urging them to capture the nuances of the sport.<br><br>Push Square is less impressed, calling Cricket 24 a \"disappointingly modest\" update that lacks creativity. VideoGamer agrees, saying it needs more polish to shine. GamingBolt gives it a similar score, saying it builds on its predecessor but could have used more fine-tuning.<br><br>And then there's Press Start Australia and Stevivor, who both think Cricket 24 is great fun... but not quite the full package. The former says it's a mixed bag with good gameplay but lacking polish, while the latter calls it \"curious\" - one of the best in the series, but with minor changes that make it hard to recommend.<br><br>So, what do I think? Well, I'm no expert (see: me reviewing a cricket game), but here's my two cents:<br><br>Cricket 24 is a solid effort from Big Ant. The gameplay is still enjoyable, and the new licensed modes are a nice touch. However, if you're already invested in past games, it might feel like more of the same.<br><br>For new players, though? It's a great starting point! The controls are accessible, and there are plenty of options to suit your skill level. Just don't expect too much innovation from this iteration.<br><br>So, should you play Cricket 24? If you're a cricket fan, definitely give it a shot. But if you're looking for something revolutionary... well, maybe wait for the next Ashes series (see: me making more cricket puns).",
