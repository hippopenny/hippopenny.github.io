Yes, you know the ones - IGN, Digitally Downloaded, Push Square, VideoGamer, GamingBolt, and Press Start Australia. They all had their say, but let's be real, no one has time for 50/50 cricket (ahem, like Cricket 24's score).<br><br>So, what's the big deal? Well, aside from some lovely visuals and presentation, there aren't too many significant changes from its predecessor, Cricket 22. It's like playing a replay during a rain delay - you might as well just re-watch the highlights. But hey, if you're new to the game (or cricket itself), this could be an exciting introduction.<br><br>One thing that stands out is the sheer number of licensed modes - relive those epic Ashes battles or forge a lengthy career. It's like having Gilly in your backyard (okay, maybe not that much). And hey, who doesn't love a good game of 20/20 cricket? (Just me, right?)<br><br>But let's get real; the AI and presentation still need some fine-tuning. And don't even get me started on those bugs and glitches - it's like trying to bowl a googly without any spin! <br><br>All in all, Cricket 24 is a solid, if not spectacular, addition to the series. It's a mixed bag of fun, with moments where you'll be hitting sixes out of the park (pun intended). If you're already invested in past games, it might feel like a minor update. But for new players, it's an accessible and enjoyable experience.<br><br>So, there you have it - Hippo Penny's Cricket 24 review: not entirely a home run, but definitely worth batting at!",
