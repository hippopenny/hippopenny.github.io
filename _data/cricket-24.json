With a plethora of critics weighing in, let's see how this one swings (pun intended).<br><br>First off, IGN gives it a solid 50, stating that it's like English opener Rory Burns - capable but inconsistent. Fair enough; I mean, who doesn't love a good cricket analogy? However, the criticism still stings, much like when your favorite team gets bowled out on the very first over.<br><br>Digitally Downloaded, on the other hand, is more optimistic, praising Big Ant's efforts to capture the nuances of the sport. They dream of an era where \"events that happened in the 10th over can impact on how bowlers, batters, and the crowd itself behave in the 40th.\" Ah, the perfect game - where tactics matter, and results are less pre-determined. I'm all for it!<br><br>Meanwhile, Push Square is rather underwhelmed, saying that Cricket 24 fails to build upon its previous installments. The only noticeable addition being franchise tournament formats? That's like adding a single, solitary sprinkler to an otherwise dry garden - not exactly the most exciting development.<br><br>VideoGamer and GamingBolt are on the same page, both giving it a mediocre 50. They agree that while Cricket 24 builds upon its predecessor visually, it lacks polish and finesse. It's like trying to hit a six when you're still finding your batting rhythm - not exactly the most thrilling experience.<br><br>Lastly, Press Start Australia gives it a slightly higher score of 60, praising the game's depth and fun gameplay. However, they also acknowledge that it's a mixed bag, lacking in visual fidelity and polish. It's like having a perfectly cooked burger with a soggy bun - you're close, but not quite there.<br><br>And finally, Stevivor gives it a score of 65, saying that it's a curious case of being one of the best in the series but with minor changes over Cricket 22. They liken it to watching a replay during a rain delay - same old, same old. For new players, however, it remains accessible and enjoyable.<br><br>So, what's my take on Cricket 24? Well, I think it's like trying to hit a cricket ball with your bare hands (don't ask me how I know this...). You might get some good shots in, but there's always room for improvement. Big Ant Studios has shown dedication to constant improvement, so maybe future updates will address the lingering issues. Until then, Cricket 24 is an enjoyable, if not exceptional, addition to the series.<br><br>That's my two cents on Cricket 24 - feel free to add your own swingin' thoughts in the comments below!",
