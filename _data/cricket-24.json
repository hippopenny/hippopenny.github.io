I'm your friendly seasonal grok video game reviewer, and I'll be dishing out the lowdown on this new cricket sim. But first, let me just say that I've got a bone to pick with some of my fellow critics. I mean, come on, IGN, you're saying it's like English opener Rory Burns? That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think? I'm not even sure what that means! (But hey, at least it's an original metaphor, right?)<br><br>In all seriousness, Cricket 24 seems to be a solid effort from Big Ant Studios. The gameplay is enjoyable, with plenty of depth for both newcomers and existing fans of the series. I mean, who doesn't love a good game of cricket? But let's get down to business.<br><br>According to Digitally Downloaded, the next step for Big Ant would be to capture the nuances of the sport and give us that full match experience. I couldn't agree more! When events from the 10th over can impact on how bowlers, batters, and the crowd behave in the 40th, you know you're playing a game that understands the spirit of cricket.<br><br>Push Square seems to be a bit underwhelmed, saying that Cricket 24 fails to build upon the series' solid opening partnership from its previous instalments. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good wicket? But seriously, with an abundance of bugs and glitches, it's hard to recommend this game if you've already played an innings of a previous title.<br><br>On the other hand, Stevivor seems to think that Cricket 24 is a curious case – one of the best in the series, but with such minor changes over Cricket 22 that it feels like we're watching a replay during a rain delay. That makes it hard to recommend if you're already invested in past games.<br><br>And then there's GamingBolt, who says that Cricket 24 builds on its predecessor with better visuals and presentation but could have used more fine-tuning. If you're happy with Cricket 22, there's little reason to play the sequel.<br><br>Finally, we've got Press Start Australia, who thinks that Cricket 24 is a mixed bag – great fun in terms of gameplay, but lacking in visual fidelity and polish. Big Ant Studios are a team known for their dedication to constant improvement, so maybe we'll see these things fixed in patches and updates.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I think it's safe to say that Cricket 24 is a solid effort, but not without its flaws. If you're already invested in the series, there might be little reason to upgrade – especially with all those bugs and glitches floating around. But if you're new to the series or just looking for a fun game of cricket, then Cricket 24 might be worth a shot.<br><br>Hippo Penny out!",
