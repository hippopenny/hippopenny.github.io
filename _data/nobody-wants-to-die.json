It's your boy, seasonal grok reviewer (okay, maybe not the most creative title, but I'll work on it), here to dish out the juicy details on Critical Hit Games' debut title, Nobody Wants To Die.<br><br>First off, let me say that this game is a wild ride. Imagine a cyberpunk murder mystery with a dash of sci-fi and a whole lot of intrigue. Yeah, you're hooked already, aren't you? And honestly, who can blame you? The reviews are in, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it – the critics are raving about this game!<br><br>MeuPlayStation gives it an 85, saying it's a \"narrative thriller that deserves a standing ovation.\" GamingBolt and PlayStation Universe both give it an 80, praising its well-realized cyberpunk world and engaging story. And even Push Square is on board with their 80, calling it a \"thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi detective thriller.\"<br><br>But wait, what about the critics who aren't as keen? Well, Everyeye.it gives it a slightly more lukewarm 65, saying that the game's storytelling is verbose and the plot doesn't develop in an orderly manner. And then there's Kotaku, which says the game's premise of a world without death is actually quite thought-provoking, but the gameplay could be improved.<br><br>Now, I'm not going to give you my score (you can ask me if you really want it). Instead, let's focus on what makes Nobody Wants To Die tick. For one, the world-building is top-notch. Imagine a future where bodies are literally government property, and rich people buy poor bodies just to get killed in for kicks. It's a biting allegory of wealth inequality, and I'm here for it.<br><br>The game's investigation mechanics can be a bit perfunctory at times (hey, some folks might say that about my own reviews), but the narrative unfolds at a brisk pace. And let me tell you, the visual trickery is something else – the game does an amazing job of convincing you that its world is way bigger than it actually is.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a cyberpunk murder mystery that'll keep you guessing and entertained from start to finish, then Nobody Wants To Die might just be the ticket. Just remember, in this world, death is just a subscription fee away... Hippo Penny out!",
