Slant Magazine gives it an impressive 80, praising its \"chaotic adaptability\" in the face of whatever wacky mash-ups come your way. GamingTrend agrees, awarding it a 85 for innovating on the foundation laid by its predecessor and providing a break from the mainstream releases of 2023.<br><br>Metro GameCentral takes things to the next level with a glowing 90, lauding its superior multiplayer co-op design and clever new ideas. TheSixthAxis also gives it a respectable 80, but warns that the game loses its way in the latter stages, leaving you wanting more non-stop silly fun ( Moving Out 3, anyone?).<br><br>Push Square scores it an 70, highlighting its colourful presentation, cheeky humour, and madcap levels for some Overcooked-like co-op goodness. GameSpew gives it a solid 80, praising its bold, colourful, and entirely silly gameplay â€“ a must-play for couch co-op fans!<br><br>And finally, GameGrin hands it a 95, calling it an enjoyable game with friends or family (just be prepared for occasional frustration when playing solo).<br><br>So, what's the takeaway from all these reviews? Moving Out 2 is a hoot! Whether you're a fan of puns, platforming, or just plain old fun with friends and family, this sequel has got it in spades. And hey, who doesn't love a good game that lets you deliver pizzas in a ridiculously oversized toga?<br><br>In conclusion, Moving Out 2 is a delightful romp that's sure to bring a smile to your face (or at least make you groan at the dad jokes). So grab some friends, get ready to move out, and have a blast!<br><br>That's it for this review! Stay tuned for more groovy gaming goodness from yours truly.",
