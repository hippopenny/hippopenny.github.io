And by \"descended,\" I mean swooped in like a ninja, stole all my free time, and replaced it with an endless supply of puns, puzzles, and platforming fun (see what I did there?).<br><br>In all seriousness, though, this sequel to the 2020 hit has gotten folks talking – or rather, laughing, screaming, and high-fiving their friends in co-op joy. But before we get to that, let's see what our fellow critics had to say.<br><br>Slant Magazine gave it an 80, praising the game's chaotic adaptability (because who doesn't love a good mashup of weird things? . GamingTrend went all out with an 85, calling Moving Out 2 \"a break from mainstream releases.\" Metro GameCentral raved about its superior multiplayer co-op, saying it maximizes its novel premise with improved level design and clever new ideas. And TheSixthAxis echoed that sentiment, giving it an 80, stating that if you loved the first one, you'll love this one even more (cliché alert!).<br><br>Push Square chimed in, too, awarding the game a 70 for its Overcooked-like co-op fun, colourful presentation, cheeky humour, and madcap levels. GameSpew gave it an 80 as well, praising its bold, colourful, and silly nature, perfect for couch co-op fans. And GameGrin? Well, they went full-on gaga with a score of 95, but warned that playing alone can get boring (what's wrong with solo fun, folks?! .<br><br>Now, my two cents: Moving Out 2 is all about embracing the absurdity and having a blast – which, spoiler alert, I had. The game's zany levels will keep you giggling, the puzzles will keep you thinking, and those platforming bits? Forget about it; your heart (and reflexes) will be racing in no time!<br><br>Will you be moving out to this sequel? Let me know in the comments!",
