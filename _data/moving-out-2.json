But after spending some quality time with this chaotic co-op romp, I've come around to its charms.<br><br>The real stars of the show are the multiplayer levels, which are just plain bonkers. Imagine playing a platformer where your buddy is controlling the same character as you, but from the other side of the screen â€“ it's like a dance, man! You'll need to communicate fast and work together to avoid getting squished by giant rolling balls or dodging laser beams while trying to get the pizza (yes, really) back into the kitchen.<br><br>I won't spoil all the silly levels for you, but let's just say there's a lot of slapstick humor involved. You'll be laughing so hard, you'll probably miss some of those pesky platforming opportunities.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about the critics?\" Well, it seems like everyone else agrees that Moving Out 2 is a blast in co-op mode (Slant Magazine), innovates on its predecessor's foundation (GamingTrend), and is simply more of the same chaos for fans of the series (TheSixthAxis). Even Metro GameCentral, known for their high standards, praised this sequel's \"superior multiplayer co-op.\"<br><br>But don't just take my word for it! The critics have spoken:<br><br>* Slant Magazine: 80<br>* GamingTrend: 85<br>* Metro GameCentral: 90<br>* TheSixthAxis: 80<br>* Push Square: 70<br>* GameSpew: 80<br>* GameGrin: 95<br><br>So, if you're looking for some friendly competition or just a goofy good time with friends or family (and let's be honest, who isn't?), Moving Out 2 is the way to go. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hankering for some moving out...",
