I'm excited to share my thoughts on this game with you, and maybe even poke fun at some of those stuffy critics along the way.<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm impressed by the sheer amount of depth and complexity that Tsukihime has to offer. It's like trying to untangle a giant ball of yarn - there are so many threads to follow, and each one is intricately woven into the larger narrative. And yet, despite the initial overwhelm, it's also surprisingly easy to get sucked in and start reading (or watching) your way through this beautifully presented game.<br><br>Now, I know some folks might be thinking, \"But what about the original Tsukihime?\" Well, let me tell you - as someone who's not exactly a hardcore fan of the series, I found that the remake was more than happy to hold my hand and guide me through the story. And trust me, it was much appreciated! The explanations and narration from Shiki's point of view really helped make the in-universe systems feel less daunting, even for someone like me who's not super familiar with the Nasuverse.<br><br>Of course, I'm not alone in my enthusiasm - many of the critics out there have been raving about this game (check out those perfect scores from Digitally Downloaded and TouchArcade!). And while I might not be as effusive as some of them, I do think that Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon is definitely a must-play for fans of dark fantasy and narrative-driven visual novels.<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, let me just say that it's high praise from this grok, er... critic. I mean, I've seen some pretty glowing reviews out there (ahem, COGconnected and Nintendo Life!), but I think mine is a bit more... down-to-earth. After all, someone has to keep things real around here.<br><br>All in all, if you're looking for a visual novel that's got it all - compelling storytelling, complex characters, rich thematic depth, and gorgeous presentation - then Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon is the perfect choice. Just don't say I didn't warn you when your brain gets tangled up in all those yarn threads... Hippo Penny out!",
