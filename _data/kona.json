And let me tell you, Kona delivers on the storytelling front.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking - \"What about the gameplay?\" Well, let me put it this way: if you're looking for something revolutionary, Kona ain't it. But hey, sometimes simplicity can be a beautiful thing. The survival mechanics and exploration elements are solid, but nothing that'll blow your mind.<br><br>And speaking of minds, I'm gonna go ahead and give a little nod to the critics who got this right. Vandal over at GameCritics gave Kona an 80, saying it's all about the narrative. SpazioGames agrees, calling it \"a good beginning for a new series.\" Meanwhile, COGconnected gave it an 80 too, praising its captivating story and stellar graphics.<br><br>Now, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - some of these reviews are straight fire (I'm looking at you, God is a Geek!). But others... well, let's just say they're a little more like me: confused and slightly annoyed. TheSixthAxis gave Kona a 60, saying it feels \"meatier\" than your average walking sim, but still had some issues with vagueness and backtracking.<br><br>And then there's Eurogamer Italy... well, let's just say they didn't exactly get their review in on time. Quotation forthcoming, indeed!<br><br>All joking aside, Kona is a solid choice for anyone looking to sink their teeth into a good mystery. It might not be the most groundbreaking game out there, but it'll keep you engaged and curious until the very end.<br><br>So, what's my verdict? Well, I'm not gonna give away my score just yet... but trust me when I say Kona is worth checking out if you're in the mood for some good old-fashioned detective work. Hippo Penny - out!",
