I mean, who doesn't love a good survival horror game? It's like having your favorite pizza (extra cheese, of course) remade with fresh toppings and an updated crust.<br><br>The critics are all abuzz about this one, and I'm not surprised. Who can resist the allure of a well-crafted remake? The Game Informer folks gave it a 90, saying it's the perfect blend of old and new. New York Daily News went whole hog, giving it a 100 and calling it \"the finest way to experience the original Dead Space.\" Even Gaming Age jumped on the bandwagon with their own 100, proclaiming it Game of The Year material.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: what about me, Hippo Penny? Well, let's just say I'm not one to cry over spilled milk (or in this case, necromorphs). I'll get to my thoughts on the game in a minute. But first, can we all just take a moment to appreciate how awesome it is that these critics are having so much fun?<br><br>Okay, okay, back to the game! So, what does Dead Space Remake do right? For starters, it's got the same eerie atmosphere and pulse-pounding action that made us fall in love with Isaac Clarke all those years ago. The new graphics are stunning, bringing the USG Ishimura to life like never before (I mean, who wouldn't want to explore a creepy spaceship?). And let's not forget about the quality-of-life improvements â€“ it's like having a personal butler (or in this case, a trusty engineer) helping you navigate the ship.<br><br>Now, I know some of you might be thinking, \"Hippo Penny, why are you being so nice to Dead Space Remake?\" Well, let me tell you, as a critic, I've got my fair share of flaws. But Dead Space Remake is like that one friend who always knows how to make you laugh (or in this case, scream). It's an exceptional revision that honors the original while also bringing something new and exciting to the table.<br><br>So, if you're looking for a survival horror game that's equal parts nostalgic and fresh, then Dead Space Remake is the perfect choice. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",
