And by everyone, I mean critics who are trying to make sense of its chaos.<br><br>First up, Nintendo Life gives it a 70, saying it's \"super fun\" and perfect for couch co-op with pals. They're right – the game is an absolute blast when you've got friends over. However, they also warn about the online mode being a total bust at launch. Yeah, I mean, what's the point of having an online mode if nobody's going to play?<br><br>Pure Nintendo chimes in with a 65, saying it's \"an odd collection of multiplayer mayhem\" that provides plenty of laughs. They're not wrong – the game is definitely quirky and fun. Just don't play alone, or you might end up with more embarrassment than entertainment.<br><br>Nintenderos and Universo Nintendo both give OddBallers an 80, praising its simplicity, entertainment value, and party vibes. They're all about that #GamingCommunity life!<br><br>Now, things get a bit mixed. TierraGamer gives it 65, saying it's hilarious but also repetitive and boring at times. Ouch! Nintenduo agrees, giving it the same score for being fun but lacking polish.<br><br>Last but not least, Multiplayer.it wraps up the review party with a 75, calling OddBallers an \"odd game in every sense\" that's all about having a good time with friends and non-gamers alike. They're spot on – this game is perfect for anyone looking to have fun without taking themselves too seriously.<br><br>So, what's the takeaway? OddBallers is an absolute blast when you've got friends around. It's got the right mix of wackiness, humor, and simple gameplay to keep everyone entertained. Just don't expect too much from the online mode at launch (yet). If you're looking for a fun party game to play with your squad or family, OddBallers is definitely worth checking out!",
