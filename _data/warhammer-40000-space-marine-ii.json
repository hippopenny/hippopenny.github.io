And by survival, I mean playing yet another Warhammer game that promises the universe to me and my trusty Space Marine squad.<br><br>Let me give you the lowdown on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, which apparently has captured the essence of the grimdark world (according to GameSkinny). They gave it a perfect score, because, well, it's just that good. And by \"just that good,\" I mean they didn't have the time or energy to critique it. Talk about a slam dunk review!<br><br>Meanwhile, 4Players.de had a great war cry (Warhammer pun intended): \"It crashes, it bangs and it looks fantastic too!\" Yes, because anything less would be unacceptable in today's gaming world. I mean, who needs a stable frame rate or working multiplayer when you have \"fantastic\" graphics?<br><br>GameWatcher joined the fun with their own glowing review: \"Straightforward linear butcher spectacle\" (because who doesn't love a good euphemism?). It's not like they were trying to be witty or anything. Just your average, everyday critical writing. <br><br> GamesRadar+ brought some excitement to the party by saying it was an exceptional shooter that left them breathless and grinning. I mean, what more could you ask for from a game? Oh wait, maybe stability and smooth gameplay?<br><br>On the other hand, we have PCGamesN, which had the audacity to mention a few minor flaws in Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2's design. Apparently, a boring story, uninteresting mission design, and proper vicious combat can all be considered letdowns in a game. How sad.<br><br>And Multiplayer.it? Well, they were just too busy playing the game to write a decent review. Talk about priorities!",
