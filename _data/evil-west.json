    "comment": "Evil West turns the vampire-hunting action into a wild and entertaining ride, despite its occasional monotony. The combat is robust, satisfying, and constantly delights with its weighty action. Though the game doesn't reinvent the wheel, it remains a well-made beat-'em-up that offers a darn fun time in the Wild West.",
