Today, I'm diving into Hauntii, a game that's got everyone talking - or rather, whispering sweet nothings in the darkness. Let me put on my best detective hat (it's a fedora) and see what the critics have to say.<br><br>The New York Times gives it a 90, calling it \"artful\" and praising its emotional impact. Yeah, okay, NYT, you're always a bit too cool for school. I mean, who doesn't love a good stick figure? You know what's also artful? A perfectly crafted peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br><br>Hardcore Gamer chimes in with a 70, saying Hauntii is \"lacking narrative and world-building.\" Ouch, that sounds like a real kick in the pants. But hey, they do acknowledge its clever level design and possession-based mechanics. I mean, who doesn't love a good exorcism? (Just me, apparently.)<br><br>GAMES.CH gives it a 79, praising its \"stunningly gorgeous\" visuals and puzzles that'll make you feel like a genius. Yeah, because nothing says \"genius\" like solving puzzles for hours on end while eating Cheetos in your underwear.<br><br>Multiplayer.it gets all grumpy with a 65, saying... actually, they didn't say anything at all! Quotation forthcoming? More like quotation non-existent, am I right?<br><br>And finally, Rock, Paper, Shotgun gives it a TBD (meaning \"To Be Decided,\" or maybe just \"I'm too lazy to give you a score\"). They do say that Hauntii is the bestest best game ever, though. So, if you don't like this review, blame RPS.<br><br>In all seriousness, Hauntii's got some real charm, folks. The gameplay's not too shabby either - I mean, who doesn't love a good possession mechanic? It's like being a ghostly Uber driver! But seriously, the world-building is where Hauntii really shines. You'll find yourself getting lost in its eerie landscapes and wondering what kind of dark magic went into making this game so darn beautiful.<br><br>All right, that's it for today's review. If you're still reading, congratulations - you must be a glutton for punishment! Or maybe you just like my brand of crazy. Either way, I hope you found something to enjoy in Hauntii. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some Cheetos to munch on while I solve some puzzles... or not. Hippo Penny out!",
