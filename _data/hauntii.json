Hauntii has been making waves with its unique blend of collectathon gameplay, atmospheric visuals, and existential themes. So, let's get down to business and see if it's worth your time (and sanity).<br><br>As I waded through the review swamp, I noticed some familiar faces - The New York Times, Hardcore Gamer, GAMES.CH, Multiplayer.it, and Rock, Paper, Shotgun all stopped by to share their thoughts. And boy, did they have a lot to say! But before we get to that, let me tell you: Hauntii is a game that will make you think. It's not just about running around, collecting stuff, or shooting things (although there is some of that too). No, this one's all about exploring the afterlife and finding your lost love (or something like that).<br><br>Now, let's see what our friends from The New York Times had to say: \"In the invitingly artful...\". Oh, wait, you get it - they liked it! Who wouldn't, with those gorgeous monochromatic visuals? I mean, I'm a seasonal reviewer, not an artist, but even I can appreciate a good minimalist aesthetic. And hey, it's not like Hauntii is just about looks; the game also does a great job of exploring what happens after we die (spoiler alert: it's not all rainbows and sunshine).<br><br>Hardcore Gamer, on the other hand, was a bit more... well, hardcore. They gave Hauntii a solid 70, praising its clever level design and possession-based mechanic. And who can blame them? That stuff is fun! I mean, I'm not saying it's as exciting as, say, a good ol' fashioned platformer or something, but it's definitely a nice change of pace.<br><br>GAMES.CH had some mixed feelings about Hauntii, though. They loved the puzzles and the visuals (again, gorgeous!), but they also found the map to be pretty unhelpful, leading to some frustrating exploration. And honestly, I can relate - I got lost in Hauntii's world more times than I can count! But hey, that's part of the charm, right?<br><br>As for Multiplayer.it... well, let's just say they're not exactly the most effusive critics out there (65/100? That's like saying, \"Meh, it's fine\"). And Rock, Paper, Shotgun? Ha! They're all about hyping up their favorite games, and Hauntii is definitely one of them. So, if you value my opinion at all, you should probably just go with RPS on this one (tbd score, but \"Bestest Bests\" seal of approval, for sure).<br><br>In conclusion, Hauntii is a game that will make you think, explore, and maybe even get lost (literally!). It's got its flaws, but it's also got some genuinely clever ideas going on. So, if you're in the mood for something a little different, give Hauntii a try! And if you don't... well, there are plenty of other games out there that might suit your fancy better.<br><br>That's all from me, folks - see you next time!",
