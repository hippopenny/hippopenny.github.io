It's that time again where I get to poke fun at myself and other critics while giving you, dear readers, an inside scoop on this spooky-ooky game.<br><br>Hauntii is an atmospheric adventure that takes us to the afterlife (yep, you read that right - the afterlife!) where we follow a faceless, tiny Druid-esque being on a quest to find its lost love. Art-wise, the game looks stunning, and I mean STUNNING! That monochromatic world might make you think it's all about being all about gray areas (get it? gray areas?), but trust me, there's more to it than that.<br><br>Now, let's get real for a sec - some critics are saying Hauntii is lacking in the narrative and world-building departments. *wink wink* But hey, even they agree that the game's subtle suggestions and clever level design make up for those shortcomings. You see, sometimes less is more (or should I say, less is more-ish?), and Hauntii proves that even a minimalist approach can lead to an enjoyable experience.<br><br>So, what makes this game so special? For starters, its possession-based mechanic adds a dash of variety to the gameplay - think challenges, mini-games, and even set-pieces! It's like they took all those \"collectathon\" games and said, \"Hey, let's make our own!\" And honestly, that's not a bad thing!<br><br>But don't just take my word for it (or should I say, the critics' words?). The New York Times gave Hauntii a 90 out of 100, calling it \"artful\" and praising its emotional impact. Hardcore Gamer agrees that while it may not be the most memorable game, it still bears a welcome level of enjoyment. And GAMES.CH? They're all about that stunning good looks (and solving puzzles - or getting frustrated trying to solve them).<br><br>On the other hand, Multiplayer.it thinks Hauntii is less centered and brave when it comes to gameplay, saying it can be confusing and unpolished at times. Rock, Paper, Shotgun, meanwhile, says don't sleep on this game (literally!). I mean, who doesn't love a good \"wake up and play\" experience?<br><br>So, what's the verdict? Well, I'm not scoring Hauntii (wink, wink). You decide whether it's worth your time or if you'll be hauntingly disappointed. Either way, Hippo Penny -!",
