As a grok critic, I'll dive into the world of Moonloop Games' latest adventure and see if it's worth your time (and sanity).<br><br>Let's start with the good stuff: Hauntii is visually stunning. The art style is a mix of dark humor and whimsy, which makes for an intriguing combination. Imagine a Tim Burton-inspired world, but instead of skeletons and cobwebs, you get adorable stick figures and an endless void. It's like someone poured a bucket of sugar into my review, making it hard to focus on the actual gameplay.<br><br>Now, onto the afterlife... err, I mean, the gameplay. Hauntii is a collectathon-styled adventure that will have you searching for your lost love (or at least, that's what the stick figures are doing). You'll traverse through levels, solving puzzles and possessing objects to progress. The possession mechanic adds a layer of variety to the game, but it's not without its challenges. Think of it as trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while being attacked by a swarm of bees.<br><br>But don't worry; I won't leave you hanging in the afterlife (see what I did there?). Critics have mixed opinions on Hauntii, with The New York Times giving it a 90 and calling it \"invitingly artful.\" Hardcore Gamer agrees, praising the game's minimalist appearance and clever level design. GAMES.CH, on the other hand, found the game to be stunningly gorgeous but frustratingly hard to solve puzzles.<br><br>As for me? Well, I'm just glad I got to play this game without losing my mind (or at least, not too much). Hauntii is an acquired taste; it's not for everyone. But if you're a fan of collectathons and possessive gameplay, you might find yourself haunting the afterlife for more.<br><br>Before I wrap up, let me address the elephant in the room: those other critics who didn't quite get it. Multiplayer.it gave Hauntii a low score without even bothering to explain why. And Rock, Paper, Shotgun? Well, they just left us hanging with that \"RPS Bestest Bests\" comment.<br><br>In conclusion, Hauntii is a game that will make you question your life choices and the afterlife. If you're up for a challenge, don't sleep on it (or do; I won't judge). It's not perfect, but it's certainly hauntingly beautiful.",
