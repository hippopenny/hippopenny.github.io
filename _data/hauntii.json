So, without further ado, let me tell you what I thought about Hauntii.<br><br>First off, the art style in this game is simply stunning. I mean, those stick figures with their soulful eyes and whatnot? It's like looking at a watercolor painting come to life! The two-tone aesthetic is also super cleverly-orchestrated, if you know what I mean. And don't even get me started on the level design - it's like a work of art!<br><br>Now, about the gameplay... Well, let me tell you, it's not all sunshine and rainbows (although, that would be nice). The puzzles can be a bit frustrating at times, especially when the map doesn't offer much help. And don't even get me started on the slower Twinstick-Shooter action moments - they're like trying to solve a Rubik's cube while being attacked by bees!<br><br>But hey, despite its flaws, Hauntii still manages to have some real charm and character (see what I did there?). The possession-based mechanic is actually pretty neat, even if it does feel a bit gimmicky at times. And those set-pieces? More like set- pieces-ing! You know what I mean - they're just so darn cool!<br><br>So, in conclusion, Hauntii may not be perfect, but it's definitely worth checking out. Just don't expect too much from me, the reviewer, because let's face it, I'm a bit of a joke (or at least that's what my therapist says).",
