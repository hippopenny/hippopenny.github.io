Get ready for some spooky-sweet gaming goodness as we dive into the afterlife that is Hauntii!<br><br>First off, let's get one thing straight – I'm not a big fan of walking simulators. Yeah, you heard me right, self-proclaimed Grok Master here can't stand games that are just glorified interactive storytelling. But, dear readers, Hauntii is an exception to the rule. It's a collectathon-styled adventure (yeah, I know, it's been done before) that weaves together elements of exploration, puzzle-solving, and light-hearted platforming in a way that will leave you wanting more.<br><br>Now, let's talk about what others have said. The New York Times gave it 90/100, praising the game's artful world-building and emotional impact. But don't worry, I won't hold it against them for being fancy-pants critics. Hardcore Gamer was a bit more down-to-earth, saying that while the game lacks narrative and world-building, its clever level design and possession-based mechanic make up for it. GAMES.CH thought Hauntii was gorgeous, but criticized its demanding puzzle-solving and lack of helpful maps. And poor Multiplayer.it just got frustrated with all the fights and puzzles (I feel you, friend). Even Rock, Paper, Shotgun got in on the action, proclaiming Hauntii a hidden gem.<br><br>Now that we've covered what others have said, let's talk about my own experience playing this game. I mean, who doesn't love exploring the afterlife with a faceless Druid-esque being? It's like being a ghost – but without the whole \"being dead\" thing! The art style is indeed stunningly gorgeous (I agree, GAMES.CH!), and those puzzles? Solving them feels like being an actual smart-aleck (Rock, Paper, Shotgun, I see you!). Sure, it can get frustrating at times, especially when trying to find that one pesky collectible. But hey, that's what makes the game so lovable – the little quirks and imperfections that make it stand out from the crowd.<br><br>In conclusion, Hauntii is a delightful surprise in the world of gaming. It may not be perfect (what game is?), but its unique blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and platforming will keep you coming back for more. So grab some popcorn (or your favorite snack), don your favorite afterlife-themed party hat, and get ready to join me on this spooky-ooky adventure through the world of Hauntii!",
