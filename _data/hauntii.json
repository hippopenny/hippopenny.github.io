But seriously, Hauntii is all about exploring the afterlife with a tiny, faceless Druid-esque being on a quest to find his lost love. It's like they took the phrase \"dead and gone\" literally! <br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What about all those other critics?\" Well, let me tell you, some folks might say Hauntii is lacking in narrative and world-building (The New York Times), but hey, who doesn't love a good mystery? And don't get me started on Hardcore Gamer - they think the game's minimalist appearance is where it shines, which is code for \"it looks like someone barfed up a mess of pixels.\" But hey, even flawed creations can bring a smile to your face (GAMES.CH), and who doesn't love a good puzzle to solve?<br><br>Now, I know some folks might say Hauntii's puzzles are more like puzzles in the sense that they're really just riddles waiting to be solved. And you know what? That's okay! After all, as Rock, Paper, Shotgun so eloquently put it: \"Parting the curtains\" is what this game is all about (see what I did there?). But hey, even Multiplayer.it agrees that Hauntii is full of character on an artistic level, and let me tell you, their words are music to my ears.<br><br>All joking aside, Hauntii is a unique little gem that's worth checking out. And who knows? Maybe you'll find yourself lost in the afterlife, but hey, at least it won't be boring!",
