Alright, alright, enough about that. On to Hauntii!<br><br>So, it seems like most critics are loving this game's artful direction, emotional impact, and possession-based mechanics. The New York Times gave it a whopping 90% - yeah, I'm looking at you, NYT, making me look bad with my non-scored review! Meanwhile, Vandal decided to keep their score under wraps... probably because they were too busy trying to solve those pesky puzzles.<br><br>GAMES.CH and Hardcore Gamer both praised the game's aesthetics and level design, although GAMES.CH was a bit miffed about having to find all those puzzles. And don't even get me started on Multiplayer.it - their review was like a rollercoaster of emotions, from excitement to frustration! Rock, Paper, Shotgun, however, gave us some top-notch hype, urging everyone to \"give this game a go.\"<br><br>Now that I've summarized the critics' opinions (try saying that three times fast!), let me share my own take on Hauntii. As someone who's all about having fun and not getting too bogged down in details, I think this game is an absolute delight! The art style is mesmerizing, the music is hauntingly beautiful, and those puzzles? Well, they're just the right amount of challenging without being frustrating.<br><br>Of course, every review is subjective, and what might be a strength for one reviewer could be a weakness for another. But hey, that's what makes gaming so wonderful - we all have our own opinions, and it's okay to disagree!<br><br>So, if you're looking for a game that'll keep you entertained, make you laugh (or cry), and maybe even teach you something about yourself or the afterlife (who knows?), then Hauntii is definitely worth checking out. Trust me, you won't regret it - unless you hate puzzles, of course!",
