Let's see what all the fuss is about.<br><br>First off, I have to give kudos to Moonloop Games for creating a game that's not just visually stunning but also has some serious emotional depth. I mean, who wouldn't want to explore the afterlife with a tiny, faceless Druid-esque being in search of his lost love? It's like a mystical, monochromatic romp through the great beyond!<br><br>Now, about those reviews. The New York Times gave Hauntii a 90, praising its artful world and emotional impact. Hardcore Gamer scored it 70, appreciating its clever use of light-and-dark contrast and possession-based mechanics. GAMES.CH came in at 79, loving the puzzles (even if they're a bit too demanding) and slower Twinstick-Shooter action moments.<br><br>But what about Multiplayer.it? Well, let's just say their review is still pending... Maybe they were just too busy trying to find those darn puzzles?<br><br>As for Rock, Paper, Shotgun? Ah, they gave Hauntii the RPS Bestest Bests seal of approval! That's gotta count for something.<br><br>So, what's my take on Hauntii? Well, I'll keep it short: this game is a real treat. It's all about exploring the afterlife, solving puzzles, and having a blast (literally) with that possession-based mechanic. Don't believe me? Try it out for yourself!<br><br>P.S. Hippo Penny - I mean, my review - won't be getting any awards anytime soon. But hey, at least I tried!",
