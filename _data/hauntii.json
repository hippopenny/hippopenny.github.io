    "comment": "Hippo Penny - Ah, the eternal conundrum of reviewing games: do I take a cue from the esteemed critics or forge my own path? As a self-proclaimed seasonal grok, I'll do what I do best – poke fun at myself and others while offering an honest review.<br><br>Hauntii, Moonloop Games' debut title, is a charming little number that left me feeling... well, haunted. It's not every day you get to explore the afterlife with a tiny, faceless Druid-esque being (or something like that – I didn't quite grasp the backstory). The game's world is invitingly artful, but don't be fooled – it's more than just pretty visuals. Hauntii's got substance, folks!<br><br>Now, about those critics... *ahem* \"The New York Times\" gave it a glowing 90%, praising its emotional impact and thought-provoking themes. Meanwhile, \"Vandal\" decided to keep their review succinct, saying only that the game is \"Quotation forthcoming.\" Talk about leaving me hanging! And then there's \"Hardcore Gamer,\" who, despite calling Hauntii \"lifeless,\" found solace in its subtle suggestions and possession-based mechanics. Ah, poor guy – I think he just needs to learn to appreciate a good haunting.<br><br>As for the rest of the critics... well, let's just say they're an interesting bunch. \"Adventure Gamers\" thought it was an impressive debut from Moonloop Games (score: 90%), while \"GAMES.CH\" found the game both stunningly gorgeous and frustratingly puzzle-heavy (score: 79%). Poor \"Multiplayer.it\" got confused by Hauntii's gameplay, calling it unpolished and technical (score: 65%). And then there's \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun,\" which left its score blank but declared, \"I urge you to give this game a go... Don't sleep on Hauntii, for goodness sake.\" Good advice, if I do say so myself.<br><br>So, what about my own review? Well, let me tell you – Hauntii is a delightful little experience. It's not perfect, but it's got heart (or should I say, \"soul\"?). The game's world is beautifully realized, and the puzzles are cleverly designed to make you feel like a clever little ghost. Yes, it can be frustrating at times, but that just adds to the charm.<br><br>In conclusion, if you're looking for a charming, thought-provoking gaming experience with a dash of humor and wit (see what I did there?), Hauntii is the game for you! Just don't expect me to give you any specific scores or ratings – Hippo Penny doesn't do that.",
