Let's start with what the critics are saying:<br><br>The New York Times thinks Hauntii is \"invitingly artful\" and that its silent stick figures have \"considerable emotional impact\". That's nice, but where's the fun? I mean, I've seen more excitement at a library book sale!<br><br>Hardcore Gamer gives Hauntii a 70, praising its \"collectathon-styled adventures\" and the way it uses light-and-dark contrast in level design. Yeah, because nothing says \"fun\" like collecting things and avoiding getting hit by enemies. Sign me up for that existential crisis!<br><br>GAMES.CH rates Hauntii at 79, calling it \"stunningly gorgeous\" but also super frustrating due to its lack of map help. Sounds like a real thrill-ride (not).<br><br>Multiplayer.it gives us a 65, saying Hauntii is full of character artistically but lacking in gameplay and technical polish. That's code for: it looks purty, but the rest is a hot mess!<br><br>And then there's Rock, Paper, Shotgun with their \"RPS Bestest Bests\" - they're just too excited to give Hauntii a score. I get it, sometimes you just have to shout about how much you love something (or maybe not in this case...). <br><br>Now that we've got the critics covered, let's get to what really matters: the gameplay! In Hauntii, you play as a tiny Druid-esque being searching for your lost love. Sounds like a real tear-jerker, right? But here's the thing - it's actually kind of fun! The puzzles can be puzzling (heh), but solving them gives you that warm-and-fuzzy feeling. And when things get hairy, the possession-based mechanic kicks in, providing some much-needed excitement.<br><br>So, is Hauntii worth your afterlife-ly earned time? I think so! It's a weird little game that'll keep you on your toes and maybe even make you cry (the good kind of crying, not like when you stub your toe on the bed frame).<br><br>That's it for this hippo penny review - if you're ready to venture into the afterlife, give Hauntii a try!",
