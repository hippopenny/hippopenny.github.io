It's like trying to decipher the secrets of the afterlife itself - only instead of eternal torment, you get to enjoy some seriously stylish and thought-provoking gameplay.<br><br>The New York Times thinks it's \"invitingly artful,\" and honestly, I can see why. The game's aesthetic is stunning, with a muted color palette that makes every puzzle-solving moment feel like a triumph. But don't just take their word for it - Vandal agrees that Hauntii has got some serious visual appeal, even if they don't say it outright.<br><br>Now, about the gameplay itself... Some folks might say it's a bit of a slow burner (get it? Because it's about the afterlife?), but I think that's part of its charm. The possession mechanic adds a delightful layer of strategy to proceedings, and those set-pieces are just the right amount of excitement to keep things lively.<br><br>Of course, not everyone will see eye-to-eye with me here. Hardcore Gamer thinks Hauntii falls short in the storytelling department (I mean, it's not like it's trying to be a narrative powerhouse or anything), while GAMES.CH is all about those puzzles - and how frustrating they can get when the map isn't your friend.<br><br>On the other hand, Rock, Paper, Shotgun seems to have had a spiritual experience with Hauntii (see what I did there?). They're not even bothering to hide their enthusiasm, urging readers to give it a go. And hey, if that's good enough for RPS, it's certainly worth a try.<br><br>So what about the rest of you? Are you ready to embark on this mystifying adventure with me? Let's see what secrets Hauntii has in store...",
