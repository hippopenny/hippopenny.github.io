As a seasoned grok video game reviewer (wink), I'm here to give you the lowdown on what makes this afterlife adventure tick.<br><br>First off, let's talk about those artful monochromatic vibes. Yeah, you read that right - mostly monochromatic. It's like Moonloop Games took a cue from their favorite emo band and decided to go full-on grayscale. And honestly? It works. The two-tone aesthetic is a breath of fresh air in an industry where bright colors can be overwhelming.<br><br>Now, about the gameplay... Ah, where do I even begin? Imagine being a tiny, faceless Druid-esque being (see what I did there?) who's on a quest to find their lost love. Sounds romantic, right? It is - until you realize that most of your time will be spent solving puzzles and collecting stuff. Don't get me wrong; the possession-based mechanic can be a lot of fun, especially when it involves mini-games or set-pieces. But let's not sugarcoat it: Hauntii is a collectathon-styled adventure at its core.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the map. I mean, come on - it doesn't offer much help? It's like trying to find your way through a dark forest without a flashlight (which, incidentally, would be super frustrating).<br><br>Now that I've ranted about the gameplay, let's talk about what the critics are saying. The New York Times gave Hauntii a respectable 90% - and honestly, their review is spot on. They get it; they understand the emotional impact of those silent stick figures and vignettes.<br><br>Hardcore Gamer, on the other hand, was a bit more mixed. They praised the game's use of light-and-dark contrast in level design and that possession-based mechanic I mentioned earlier. But ultimately, they called Hauntii \"flawed\" - which is fair, considering some of the criticisms I've already mentioned.<br><br>GAMES.CH got a little too excited about the puzzles, calling them \"stunningly gorgeous.\" While I agree that finding those puzzle solutions can be rewarding, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The map issue still stands, after all.<br><br>Multiplayer.it was, well... less enthusiastic. They thought Hauntii was beautiful during exploration phases but frustrating in fights and puzzles. Yep, that sounds like my experience too - a bit of both, to be honest.<br><br>And then there's Rock, Paper, Shotgun, who decided to leave their score blank (tbd) and just told everyone to give the game a go. I mean, when RPS gives you a \"Bestest Best\" seal of approval, it's hard not to take notice.<br><br>So what's my verdict? Well, that's up to you to decide. If you're looking for a more relaxing experience with some great puzzle-solving and exploration, Hauntii might be the game for you. But if you're expecting a super challenging or polished experience, you might want to look elsewhere.<br><br>In any case, Hippo Penny - it's been a blast reviewing this one. I hope you enjoyed my wacky take on Hauntii as much as I did!",
