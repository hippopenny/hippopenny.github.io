As someone who's not a seasoned RPG fan (see what I did there?), I can confidently say that this game will make you feel all the feels.<br><br>But let me tell you, folks - as a self-proclaimed \"seasonal\" reviewer, I was a bit skeptical about diving back into a game I already loved. After all, it's easy to get stuck in nostalgia mode and overlook any new content. And honestly? The critics did their job, and the reviews were glowing (pun intended).<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What does this reviewer have to say that hasn't been said before?\" Well, let me tell you - as someone who's not a hardcore gamer, I can bring a fresh perspective to the table. And trust me when I say that even if you've played NieR: Automata before, the Game of the YoRHa Edition is still worth your time.<br><br>So, what makes this package so special? For starters, it's the perfect starting point for new players (like yours truly). No prior knowledge of the series is required - just strap in and get ready to experience a wild ride. And if you're already familiar with the game, well... let's just say that revisiting these characters and storylines can be a real treat.<br><br>Of course, I'm not going to lie - there are some minor quibbles (read: no new content). But honestly? That's a small price to pay for the sheer quality of this game. And hey, if you're anything like me, you'll want to replay it anyway just to see what you might have missed the first time around.<br><br>So, in conclusion - Hippo Penny or not - NieR: Automata - Game of the YoRHa Edition is a must-play (or revisit) for anyone who loves action-packed RPGs. And if you don't believe me? Well, I've got a whole bunch of critics who agree (see below).",
