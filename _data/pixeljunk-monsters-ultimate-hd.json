Now, I know what you're thinking - another tower defense game? Zzz... But trust me, this one's got some serious mojo working in its favor.<br><br>First off, let me just say that I'm a sucker for a good port. When done right, it can be like a breath of fresh air (or a groovy vinyl record, if you will). And PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD is the perfect example. Taking all the original's DLC content and retooling it with some snazzy touch controls? That's just pure magic.<br><br>Now, I know my fellow critics are going to rave about this game - ZTGD gave it a 90, IGN a 90, Games Master UK an 84... You get the picture. And let me tell you, they're not wrong. This game is chock-full of charm, wit, and even a pinch of sass (I mean, who doesn't love a good \"Hippo Penny\" reference, am I right?). But what really sets it apart is its sheer replay value.<br><br>I mean, 70 levels? That's like having an endless supply of funky tunes to groove to. And don't even get me started on the visuals - those pixel art monsters are just too cool for school. Okay, okay, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about co-op?\" Well, let me tell you, while it's a bummer that it doesn't carry over into single-player mode, it's not like the game is missing its soul or anything. And hey, at least we don't have to worry about those pesky difficulty spikes (although, I mean, who doesn't love a good challenge, am I right?).<br><br>All in all, PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD is a must-have for any Vita owner looking for some quality tower defense fun on the go. And if you're feeling extra generous, throw it onto your PS3 or PSP for even more funky action.<br><br>So, what are you waiting for? Get ready to groove with PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD!",
