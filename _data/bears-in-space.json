    "comment": "Bears in Space is a wild and wacky adventure that combines FPS action with bullet-hell mechanics and comedy. With a colorful and absurdly charming gameplay, this game will leave you with a perpetual smile on your face, making it a solid choice for casual players looking for some quirky fun. The game's mix of platforming, challenging boss battles, and enjoyable mini-games provides a varied and entertaining experience, despite some minor glitches. Bears in Space is a delightful and ridiculous debut title from Broadside Games, perfect for those craving a kitschy comedy 3D boomer shooter renaissance.",
