Grab your trusty Naginata and get comfy, because we're diving into the depths of this JRPG phenomenon!<br><br>First off, let's talk about those fancy review scores. You know, the ones that critics love to flaunt like a demon-fusing prodigy flexing their digital muscles? Yeah, we're gonna skip those and dive right into the juicy bits. Who cares if Digitally Downloaded gave it a perfect score when we can have some real fun?<br><br>Now, onto the good stuff! Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is all about that sweet, sweet demon fusion action. Imagine being able to summon an army of mischievous monsters and watch them wreak havoc on unsuspecting foes. It's like having a whole squad of cuddly critters at your beck and call!<br><br>But wait, what's this? Worth Playing thinks it's the \"definitive version\" of the game? Ah, come on! That's like saying the best way to eat pizza is by staring at it for 10 minutes before taking a bite. I mean, sure, it's an improvement over the original, but let's not get too ahead of ourselves here!<br><br>Voxel chimes in with some words of wisdom: \"If you like Japanese RPGs and have never played them, I would say that Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is a must-buy.\" Ah, thank you, Voxel, for reminding us that even non-gamers can get in on the fun! (Just don't try to fuse any demons with your aunt's knitting needles – we warned you!)<br><br>MeuPlayStation thinks it's \"one of the best JRPGs in recent years\"? Okay, okay, I'll give 'em that. The combat is addictive, and those maps are like a treasure trove of hidden secrets! (But don't tell anyone I got stuck on the same screen for an hour because I forgot to save...)<br><br>Areajugones goes all gaga over Atlus' new version, saying it's \"not just a new version\" but an actual new game?! Ah, you crazy kids and your hyperbole! While we're at it, why don't we just give every game a perfect score and call it a day?<br><br>And then there's Impulsegamer, who says the added content more than makes up for the game's core issues. Y'know what? That's like saying that even if your cat decides to use the bathroom outside of its litter box (again), you can just shrug it off and give 'em treats!<br><br>Last but not least, Push Square reminds us that Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is all about that combat-heavy action. Ah, yeah, because nothing says \"fun\" like watching your demons get pummeled for 20 minutes straight...<br><br>So there you have it, folks! A wild ride through the world of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. Who knows? You might just find yourself joining me in this demonic dance party, where the only thing more plentiful than demon fusions is witty banter!<br><br>Stay tuned for more Hippo Penny-ific reviews, and remember: it's not just about the score – it's all about having a blast!",
